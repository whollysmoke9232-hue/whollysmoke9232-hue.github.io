**Romans 1:17**

> *“For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith…”*  
> —Romans 1:17

This righteousness is not achieved—it is credited.  
It is the righteousness that God places into our account by faith.

There is nothing I can do to earn this righteousness.  
It is given freely, received by faith alone.

It begins with faith,  
produces faith,  
and ends with faith.

And it requires nothing more than faith the size of a mustard seed.

Faith is all we bring to the table at salvation—**justification**.  
Faith is also the goal of our lives after salvation—**sanctification**.

By faith, our lives are gradually transformed into the image of Christ Jesus, as we apply what He has revealed through His Word.

And even this faith is not self-generated.

Faith itself is a gift—given by the Holy Spirit.

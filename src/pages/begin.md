## Begin

These writings were never created to fulfill a plan or advance an agenda.

Each piece was written in response to something lived, observed, read, or endured — often without any thought of where it might belong later. Over time, themes began to emerge, and the collections you see here were formed organically, after the fact.

This library is offered as it is, not as instruction, but as witness — in the hope that others might find encouragement, strength, or the quiet resolve to endure.

  <!-- Row 1 — Bondage and Release -->
  <a href="/bondage-and-release#/" title="Bondage and Release">
    <img src="{{ '/images/cell-door.png' | url }}" alt="Bondage and Release" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>

  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="/bondage-and-release/" title="Bondage and Release">
        If you are caught in patterns you cannot break
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These readings are for those who find themselves repeating what they long to escape. They do not offer quick fixes or simple answers, but honest witness to grace that meets us in confinement—and begins release from within it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Row 2 — Hurt and Restoration -->
  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="/hurt-and-restoration#/" title="Hurt and Restoration">
        If you have been wounded by others
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These writings are for those carrying injuries they did not choose. They speak gently to harm, betrayal, and loss, without minimizing pain or rushing healing—holding space for restoration that unfolds in its own time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <a href="/hurt-and-restoration#/" title="Hurt and Restoration">
    <img src="{{ '/images/crutches.png' | url }}" alt="Hurt and Restoration" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>

  <!-- Row 3 — Weariness and Renewal -->
  <a href="/weariness-and-renewal#/" title="Weariness and Renewal">
    <img src="{{ '/images/weary-traveler.png' | url }}" alt="Weariness and Renewal" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>

  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="/weariness-and-renewal#/" title="Weariness and Renewal">
        If you are weary and need encouragement
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These readings are for seasons of exhaustion, when faith feels thin and strength feels spent. They are offered as quiet companionship—reminding us that rest, renewal, and perseverance often arrive slowly, and together.
      </p>
  </div>

  <!-- Row 4 — Written in Confinement -->
  <div>
    <h3>
      <a href="/tags/confinement/" title="Written in Confinement">
        If you have met God in a place you did not choose
      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      These writings were composed in quiet confinement — not polished, not curated, but lived. They are offered as they were written: immediate, surrendered, and honest.
    </p>
  </div>

  <a href="/tags/confinement/" title="Written in Confinement">
    <img src="{{ '/images/cell-desk.png' | url }}" alt="Written in Confinement" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>

  <!-- Row 5 — About the Author -->
  <a href="/about-the-author#/" title="About the author">
    <img src="{{ '/images/chatgpt-steve-2.png' | url }}" alt="About the Author" style="max-width: 100%; border-radius: 8px;">
  </a>

  <div>

      </a>
    </h3>
    <p>

## Hearing God

Hearing God is not primarily about technique, but attention. These readings explore how God speaks in quietness, in Scripture, in suffering, and in the removal of noise.

## Learning to Be Still

These readings invite you into quiet attention—where stillness becomes not absence, but awareness.

{% set entries = readingPaths['hearing-god'] %}
<ul>
{% for entry in entries %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}?path=hearing-god-be-still">
      {{ entry.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Removing the Noise

Sometimes what we need most is not more words, but fewer distractions. These readings attend to what competes for our attention—and how to gently lay it down.

{% set entries = readingPaths['hearing-god-removing-noise'] %}
<ul>
{% for entry in entries %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}?path=hearing-god-removing-noise">
      {{ entry.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Hearing Through Scripture

God often speaks most clearly where He has already spoken. These readings return to Scripture—not as information alone, but as encounter.

{% set entries = readingPaths['hearing-god-through-scripture'] %}
<ul>
{% for entry in entries %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}?path=hearing-god-through-scripture">
      {{ entry.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Hearing God in Suffering & Waiting

There are seasons when suffering becomes the loudest voice in the room. These readings reflect on how God remains present—and sometimes most clearly heard—within it.

{% set entries = readingPaths['hearing-god-in-suffering'] %}
<ul>
{% for entry in entries %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}?path=hearing-god-in-suffering">
      {{ entry.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Discernment & Obedience

Responding to what has been heard

{% set entries = readingPaths['discernment-and-obedience'] %}
<ul>
{% for entry in entries %}
  <li>
    <a href="{{ entry.url }}?path=discernment-and-obedience">
      {{ entry.title }}
    </a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

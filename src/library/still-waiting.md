## Still Waiting

> _And now, Lord, for what do I wait?  
> My hope is in You._ **—Psalm 39:7**

Every time I stumble across this verse, it feels like splashing my face with cold water.

I have a tendency to get lost in my fears. What if I never reconcile with my children? What if my ex-wife forgets me? What if I am never able to secure gainful employment? What if I never find a place to live that doesn’t rely on the kindness of friends? What if … What if … It goes on and on.

When I get stuck in this loop, I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking of ways to avoid all my imagined fears. I should write letters to my kids. Send occasional gifts to my ex-wife. Push harder on getting resumes out. Find low-cost housing. I search the internet and query artificial intelligence. 

I endlessly rework my budget and reexamine what I think I can live without. I look for ways to cut corners on expenses. I imagine conversations with family members. I bury myself in potential scenarios that could guide me in the direction I think I should go.

None of these are wrong; but none bring relief.

Then in the midst of my anxiety, I wander into Psalm 39, and here comes the cold water again to shake me from my funk and remind me of where I actually stand.

I'm reminded ask myself, *“For real, Steve! What are you waiting for? What exactly are you thinking you can do to make any real difference in your present or future?”* It causes me to refocus on Whose I am.

I rediscover that in order to focus on my fears, I first have to take my eyes off of Jesus.

In my fear, I find that I feel profoundly empty. Nervous. I want to avoid the future. But when my focus turns back to my Saviour, relief comes rushing back in like a flood. Suddenly, my fears lose their grip and I’m once again filled with faith and courage. Eager to embrace my future.

This is a sobering truth; but a welcome one. My hope is in a heavenly Father who has proven that He will never leave or forsake me. Whatever my future may hold, He is in control of it. And if He is in control, I have nothing to fear.

## Prayer

> Father,  
> You see how quickly my mind runs ahead of You.  
> You see the fears I rehearse and the futures I try to manage.  

> When my heart asks “What if?”  
> teach it to answer, “My hope is in You.”  

> Give me courage to do what is mine to do,  
> and peace to release what is Yours alone.  

> Help me wait without panic,  
> trust without pretending,  
> and rest in the fact that I am Yours.  

> Amen.

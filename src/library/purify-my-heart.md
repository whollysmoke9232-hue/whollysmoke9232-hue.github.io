## A Prayer

O God,  
purify my heart, for I long to see more of You.

I've seen Your hand.  
I've experienced a taste of Your love.  
I've been given a glimpse of Your glory.  

But I want to see **more of You**.

Purify my heart.  
Cleanse me.  
Reveal my sin.  
Burn away my chaff.

I desire a deep cleansing.

Create in me a clean heart—  
a new heart,  
so that all that is left standing in me  
is You.

I don't want to remember my sin.  
I don't want to long for sinful things.

I seek You.  
I seek Your will—Your perfect will.

Fix my mind in innocence.  
My imagination in purity.

Lead me in truth.  
Steady me with Your hand.

You are all I need.  
You are all I want.

O God,  
purify my heart,  
for I long to see more of You.

## Takeaway Thought

Purity is not about restraint alone—it is about **clarity of desire**.  
A pure heart longs for God above all else.

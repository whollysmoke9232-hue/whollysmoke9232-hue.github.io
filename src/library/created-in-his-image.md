What came first, the chicken or the egg?  

Do we instinctively protect our eyes so David could write,
> *“Keep me as the apple of the eye;”* **—Psalms 17:8**  

Was David inspired only after the Spirit observed humanity guarding this fragile part of the body? Did our protection of the eye simply become a metaphor for covenant love — or did God have David’s heart in mind when He created the eye?  

Did God create reality with metaphors already inside it?  

I sometimes wonder why we were made with certain features. Because we were created in Their image — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Do we have arms so Jesus could be suspended by nails through His wrists?  

What came first — Christ’s body, our creation, or the crucifixion?  

We usually read Genesis like this:
> God → makes man → later becomes like man  

But what if we were made in the image of the God who would become human and be crucified?  

The template may not be Adam, but the incarnate Christ — the wounded, resurrected human already present in the mind of God.  

From inside time we see:
> creation → incarnation → crucifixion  

But from outside time:
> Christ → cross → creation built to hold it  

The cross may not interrupt the story.  

It may be the center the story was built around.  

Creation becomes a stage shaped for redemption.  

So the cross does not use the body — the cross reveals what the body always meant.  

> Hands were always for giving.  
> Skin always for bearing.  
> Eyes always for guarding.  
> Life always for offering.  

Creation is not arranged around future events. It reflects the character of the One who made it.  

So when the cross happens, it does not feel foreign to the world — it fits it.  

Not prediction, but coherence.  

It may be that humanity was not designed merely to live,
> but to reveal the kind of God who gives Himself.

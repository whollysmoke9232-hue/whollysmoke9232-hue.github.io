There is a question that lingers beneath much of my prayer life:  
Why do I so rarely expect God-sized answers?

I often find myself praying cautiously, asking for what feels reasonable, manageable, safe. I believe God can answer prayer—but usually only the kind that stays close to the surface of my expectations.

I imagine prayer like standing at the front of a store, settling for what is immediately visible and easily reached. Small things. Acceptable things. Things I can picture God saying yes to without much trouble.

But what if God’s intention has always been deeper than that?

What if the many “no’s” I experience are not refusals at all, but invitations to keep walking—to move past what is small and familiar and into places I would never think to ask for on my own?

So often, I grow frustrated before I ever arrive there. I mistake delay for denial. I assume disappointment means God is unwilling, when it may simply mean He is leading me further than I am comfortable going.

I ask for little things, not because God is small, but because my expectations are.

And yet, Scripture tells a different story—of a Father who delights in giving good gifts, who knows what we need before we ask, and who is not constrained by the limits of my imagination. God is not hesitant to give His best. He is patient enough to lead us toward it.

Perhaps the invitation of prayer is not to ask more quickly, but to ask more deeply. Not to settle for what feels safe, but to trust that God’s generosity exceeds my fear.

So I am learning—slowly—to pray differently.  
To walk past the front of the store.  
To believe that God is not only able, but willing.  
And to ask, with trembling hope, for what only He can give.  

## Prayer

> Father,

> Forgive my small expectations.
> When I settle for what feels safe, lead me deeper.
> Teach me not to mistake delay for denial,
> and give me courage to ask for what only You can give.

> Stretch my hope to match Your generosity.
> Amen.

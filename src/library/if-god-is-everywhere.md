## Key Scripture

> *“Where can I go from Your Spirit?*  
> *Or where can I flee from Your presence?”*  
> **—Psalm 139:7 (NIV)**

---

If God is everywhere, then I do not merely walk with Him—I exist within Him. I breathe in His presence, and He breathes through mine.

If God is everywhere, then “as far as the east is from the west” is still within His embrace. There is no exile from His love, no distance from His gaze.

If God is everywhere, then He sees me as I am, as I was, and as I will be—all at once. Not in sequence, but in fullness. Not in progress, but in completion.

If God is everywhere, then He knows everything that can be known about me—and infinitely more. The things I hide, the things I fear, the things I don’t yet understand about myself—He holds them all without flinching.

If God is everywhere, then what I call an obstacle is both there and not there. It is real in my time, but resolved in His. It is a shadow cast by a light I haven’t yet seen.

If God is everywhere, then He is not “working on me.” He has already finished. I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.

If God is everywhere, then all of my current and future problems have already been solved. All of my questions already answered. I am not waiting for clarity—I am walking toward it.

If God is everywhere, then maybe when I get to Heaven, I’ll realize I’ve been there all along. That eternity was never a destination, but a dimension I was always tethered to.

If God is everywhere, then even my sins and weaknesses will become stained-glass windows—broken pieces made beautiful by the light of His grace.

If God is everywhere, then the power that created galaxies and raised Jesus from the grave dwells in me. Not metaphorically. Literally.

If God is everywhere, then I am connected to everything—because everything exists within Him. Every atom, every angel, every moment, every miracle.

If God is everywhere, then nothing is impossible for me. Because nothing is impossible for Him. And He is not just beside me—He is in me. And I am in Him.

## Prayer

> Lord, expand my awareness of Your nearness. Help me to rest in the truth that I am never outside Your presence, never beyond Your reach, and never unseen by Your love. Teach me to live from that reality, with trust, humility, and awe.  
> Amen.

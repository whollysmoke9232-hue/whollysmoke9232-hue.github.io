Why is it so hard to get out of our own way?

If a runaway dump truck were barreling toward us, every fiber of our being would scream, _“Get out of the way!”_ And we would.  
If we knew a meteorite was heading for our location, we’d scramble to safety.  
If someone intended us harm, we’d instinctively flee.

These are situations where our natural *fight or flight* response kicks in.

But what about when something **good** is coming our way?

It seems that one of the greatest obstacles to receiving what God desires to do in us is often… *us*.  
Not because God is restrained—but because we are distracted, resistant, or misaligned with His work.

I’m reminded of a familiar preacher’s story—not as doctrine, but as illustration:

> A man died and went to heaven, where Jesus showed him the wonders of eternity—family reunited, the beauty of heaven, and a mansion prepared for him.  
>  
> Eventually, they came to a street of warehouses. One bore the man’s name. Inside were countless gifts.  
>  
> “What is all this?” the man asked.  
>  
> Jesus replied, _“These are things I longed to give you—but you were too busy chasing other things.”_

The point isn’t regret—it’s revelation.

Jesus explains this tension in the Parable of the Sower:

> _“The worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.”_ **—Mark 4:18–19**

Notice: the problem isn’t evil.  
It’s **distraction**.  
The “other things” are often good things—just not **Him**.

God is not trying to make us better versions of ourselves.  
He is making us **new** (Revelation 21:5).

And while God is never limited in power or purpose, **our openness, attention, and surrender determine how much fruit His work produces in us**.

Sometimes the roadblocks aren’t sin—but self-direction.  
Even spiritual activity can become an obstacle when it replaces intimacy.  
When the focus shifts from the **Giver** to the gifts, from **His presence** to our pursuits, we quietly step out of alignment.

So maybe the prayer isn’t,  
“God, do something new,”  
but rather,  
“God, help me stop getting in the way of what You are already doing.”

If you want something you’ve never had,  
you may need to release something you’ve been holding too tightly.

Not in defeat—but in trust.

**I surrender. I choose Your way. I want Your best—whatever that is.**  
And sometimes, the holiest thing we can do…  
is step aside.

## Prayer

> Lord, pull up the thorns.  
> Expose the subtle distractions.  
> Align my heart with what You are already doing.  
> I don’t want more activity—I want **You**.  
> Amen.

### Names Then and Now

> *Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.* **—Daniel 1:6**

In our modern culture, names often function as little more than labels. They distinguish us on a roster or a form, but they rarely carry deep meaning. I remember a season when it seemed like every other girl was named “Linda”—a popular name, but not one tied to destiny.

In the Old Testament, names were different. They were weighty. A name could be a sentence, a prayer, even a prophecy. It declared identity, character, and calling. Children grew up knowing who they were by knowing what their name meant—and who their God was.

What we do often flows from who we believe ourselves to be.  

Identity shapes destiny.

Consider the names of Daniel and his friends (Daniel 1:5–7):

- **Daniel** — “God is my Judge” (and therefore his Deliverer)  
- **Hananiah** — “The LORD is gracious”  
- **Mishael** — “Who is like God?”  
- **Azariah** — “The LORD is my helper”

Notice this: their names say more about **God** than about them.  
Their worth and identity were rooted not in performance, but in who God is.

### Babylon’s Renaming Strategy

> *Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego.* **—Daniel 1:7**

These four young men—likely no older than fifteen—were taken into Babylon, the cultural and spiritual center of a pagan empire. God placed them there as witnesses, not by force or rebellion, but by faithfulness.

The first thing Nebuchadnezzar did was rename them.

Satan understands identity. He knows that if he can redefine who we are, behavior will follow.

- **Belteshazzar** — “Under the authority of Bel”  
- **Shadrach** — “Under the command of Aku”  
- **Meshach** — “Who is like Sheshach”  
- **Abednego** — “Servant of Nego”

Isn’t it striking that we often remember their Babylonian names instead of their God-given ones?

Yet despite what they were called, these men lived according to the names they had grown up with. They knew who they *were*. They refused to internalize the lie.

### The Names We Accept

The same strategy is still at work. We are all given names throughout our lives.

“You’re worthless.”  
“You’ll never change.”  
“You’re a failure.”  
“You’re unlovable.”

Sometimes the names sound flattering—status, success, comparison—but they still define us apart from God.

If we don’t know who we are in Him, we will accept almost any name offered. And once we accept a name, we tend to live consistently with it—even when it destroys us.

Behavior modification alone never lasts.  

Identity transformation does.

### Your New Name in Christ

The Gospel announces something radical:  
> The names given to you by the world are dead.

In Christ, you are no longer defined by your past, your failures, or the labels others gave you. You now bear **His Name**.

- Christ lives in me **(Galations 2:20)** 
- Loved by God **(John 3:16)** 
- The righteousness of God **(2 Corinthians 5:21)** 
- Washed and redeemed **(I Corinthians 6:11)** 
- Light of the world **(Matthew 5:14-16)** 
- More than a conqueror  **(Romans 8:37)**

When we act out of step with this new identity, conviction rises—not as condemnation, but as confirmation. The discomfort proves something new has taken root.

They may call you many things.  

But if they don’t use your true name, you don’t have to answer.

I’ve run from You  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from Your call to live  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’ve embraced the trap of sin.  

I sought rest from torment  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from grief and pain  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but no rest was found within.  

I trusted my strength  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my will and resolve  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to carry me to the end  
But I was weak  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lost in the dark  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always deeper drawn in  

Thought I’d found bottom  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the end of my struggle  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the path to end my strife  
I lied to myself  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I failed to embrace  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the One to restore my life  

He never gave up  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continued to call  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for me to surrender my heart  
Now new life I’ve found  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the palm of His hand  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in His love I’ve found a new start

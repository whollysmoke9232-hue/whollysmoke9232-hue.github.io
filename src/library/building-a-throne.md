**Giving thanks:**  
Involves listing the gifts we have been given and acknowledging that God is the Giver.

**Praise:**  
Involves seeing deeper into that transaction and acknowledging that God is still in the gifts. They are connected to Him. The gift *is* God Himself.

**Worship:**  
Moves beyond any gift and focuses on the person of God — seeing ourselves in comparison to Him, yet somehow invited into relationship with Him.

> (In jail, I had few gifts left to list. But I could still worship.
And that is where I discovered that worship does not depend on abundance.
It depends on who God is.)

> _“Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;  
> dishonor has covered my face.”_ **—Psalms 69:7**

---

O God, this isn’t about me at all.  
It is about You.  
It has always been about You.  
You alone.

How could I think that any of this was for me?  
All of this is to bring You glory.

I can’t see the end.  
I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.  
Men will turn to You.  
They will know that You alone are God—  
the only God who delivers men from sin.

It is You who rescues,  
You who redeems,  
You who lifts my soul from the grave.

It is You who has set my feet on a firm foundation.

You are God.  
To You I give my life.  
To You I offer my worship.  
My life is in Your hands.  
There is nowhere I would rather be.

## Prayer

> _O God, I surrender not only my suffering, but my understanding.  
> I place my life, my pain, and my purpose fully into Your hands.  
> Be glorified in me, even here._  
> Amen.

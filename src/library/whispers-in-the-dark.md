> *“LORD, see how my enemies persecute me!  
Have mercy and lift me up from the gates of death,”* **—Psalms 9:13 (NIV)**

*6/9/2024 (Written in confinement)*

O God, look upon me in mercy.

Observe and take note of how relentlessly the enemy torments me.

They continuously whisper in my ear —

*Tempting me.*  
*Calling me.*  
*Reminding me of who I was.*  
*Reminding me of the “fun” of sin.*  
*Replaying past sin.*

*Digging pits before me.*  
*Laying stumbling blocks in my path.*  
*Showing me deceitful paths.*  
*Distracting me.*

Yet You allow me to grow stronger as I trust in You.

Father, rescue me.

Remind me of the truth.

You are my fortress.  
You are my shelter.  
You are my deliverer.  

**You —**  
**Only You —**  
**Are my hope**  
**And my future.**

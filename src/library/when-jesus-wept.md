## Key Scripture

> _“Jesus wept.”_ **—John 11:35**

---

It’s the shortest verse in the Bible—just two words. And yet, those two words carry the weight of eternity.

***“Jesus wept.”***

Why would the Son of God—who knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead—pause to weep at a tomb?

## Back to the Beginning

> _“God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.”_ **—Genesis 1:31**

In the beginning, there was no death, no sorrow, no brokenness. Creation pulsed with harmony, beauty, and life.

But then came the fall.

Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came the curse:

> _“Cursed is the ground because of you…”_ **—Genesis 3:17**

From that moment on, everything changed. Sin infected not just human hearts, but the very fabric of creation. Death became a reality. Tears became a language. And the world began to groan under the weight of what was lost.

## The Grief of God

So when Jesus stood at Lazarus’ tomb and saw Mary weeping, Scripture tells us He was “deeply moved in spirit and troubled.”

The Greek word used here suggests more than sadness—it implies indignation, even outrage.

Jesus wasn't sad. He was angry.

He wasn’t angry at the people.  
He wasn’t angry at their grief.  
He was angry at what sin had done.

At the pain.  
At the loss.  
At the distortion of what was once “very good.”

## Why Jesus Wept

- Jesus wept because this was not how it was supposed to be.
- He wept over the sting of death.
- He wept over the sorrow of His friends.
- He wept over a world broken by sin.

And He still weeps today.

Not because He is powerless.  
Not because He is surprised.  
But because He loves.

And love always grieves what wounds the beloved.

Jesus hates sin—not merely because it is rebellion, but because of what it does to us.  

To His creation.  
To His children.

And one day, He will wipe away every tear…  

***because He wept first.***

## Prayer

> Lord Jesus, thank You for being a Savior who weeps.  
> Thank You for feeling the weight of our sorrow and the sting of our brokenness.  
> Help me to hate sin—not just for what it is, but for what it does.  
> Give me eyes to see the world as You see it, and a heart that longs for restoration.  
> May I live in the hope that You are making all things new.  
> Amen.

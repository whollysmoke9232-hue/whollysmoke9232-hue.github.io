> *“When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,  
The moon and the stars, which You have ordained;  
What is man that You take thought of him,  
And the son of man that You care for him?”* **—Psalms 8:3-4**

*6/8/2024 (Written in confinement)*

You didn’t just scatter the stars as a farmer scatters seed. You put each star in its place and called it by name. Not only that, but all the physical laws and forces that currently operate were already fully functioning. You had already worked out nuclear fusion and fission, magnetic forces, orbits, rotations, chemical reactions, mathematical formulas, neurons, electrons, quarks, black holes, emotions, communication, love, choice, life, and death.

Nothing was accidental. Everything was created or made with purpose. Everything that exists has a reason for existing.

While You alone are the undisputed star of this magnificent show, man is the object of Your affections. You created man and gave him abilities beyond any other creature. To man You gave the desire and ability to worship. You reach out to man and call him to Yourself. You reveal that all creation draws and directs man to You. You have given man every reason to rely on, look to, trust in, love, and worship You.

You speak to man. You call him by a name that only You know. When we submit to You, You change us. You transform us from a purely material-minded being into a spiritual being who can live in communion with You. You make us look much more like You. You become our very reason to live. And when we die, we are with You for all eternity.

Hallelujah!

Great is Your faithfulness.”* **—Lamentations 3:23**

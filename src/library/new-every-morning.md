## Key Scripture

> _“The LORD’S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease,  
> For His compassions never fail.  
> They are new every morning;  
> Great is Your faithfulness.”_  
> —Lamentations 3:22–23

There is no end to the creative ways God reveals His love. Just when I think He’s exhausted every method—**BOOM**—another masterpiece of mercy. A sunset. A flower. A memory. A smile from a stranger, or even a whispered correction. Each one becomes a brushstroke in His eternal mural of compassion.

> **“The LORD’S lovingkindnesses indeed never cease.”**

He knows my heart, my frailty, my thoughts—because He made me. He designed every response, every longing. And when I’m hurting, afraid, lonely, or confused, He meets me with the perfect passage of Scripture. Not as a distant deity, but as Immanuel—God with us. God *with me*.

> **“For His compassions never fail.”**

Each new morning reveals more of His endless care. His Word, His people, His discipline, His healing—layer after layer of love. Nothing withheld. No moment untouched by grace.

> **“They are new every morning.”**

He is constant. Unchanging. Faithful in every season. The sun never skips a morning. Winter always yields to spring. And I am always—*always*—held in His hands.

> **“Great is Your faithfulness.”**

## Prayer

_Lord, thank You for pursuing me endlessly, for loving me creatively and faithfully. Let my mornings greet Your mercy and my nights rest in Your compassion. And even when I don’t feel it—when my heart forgets—remind me again, like sunrise after darkness, that Your love has never ceased._  
**Amen.**

## Takeaway Thought

**God’s mercy doesn’t carry over from yesterday—it meets you brand new today.**

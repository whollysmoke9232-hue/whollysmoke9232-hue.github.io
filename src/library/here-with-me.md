Millions of people calling Your Name  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;every face You see  
Oh, my God, how can it be  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that You would be here with me  

The sun, the moon, stars in the sky  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;each set in place by Thee  
their light and course maintained by You  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yet, You’re here with me  

How can I know  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or can it be known  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the how’s and why’s of Your plan  
The sun, the moon, stars in the sky  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and yet, You’re here with me

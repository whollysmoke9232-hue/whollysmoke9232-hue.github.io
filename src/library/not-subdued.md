> *Turn Your footsteps toward the perpetual ruins;  
The enemy has damaged everything within the sanctuary.  
Your adversaries have roared in the midst of Your meeting place;  
They have set up their own standards for signs.*  
>  
> *It seems as if one had lifted up  
His axe in a forest of trees.  
And now all its carved work  
They smash with hatchet and hammers.*  
>  
> *They have burned Your sanctuary to the ground;  
They have defiled the dwelling place of Your name.  
They said in their heart, “Let us completely subdue them.”  
They have burned all the meeting places of God in the land.*  
—Psalm 74:3–8

“**Let us completely subdue them.**”

Israel had already been trampled militarily. They had been humiliated through siege. Politically, they were powerless. But there was still one thing Babylon had not fully extinguished: the spark of worship.

Babylon understood something vital. Before Israel could be fully broken, their place of worship had to be destroyed. So they looted the precious metals, toppled the stones, and burned what remained to the ground. Only then did they carry the nation into exile. This was not merely conquest—it was an attempt at spiritual erasure.

Our enemy has not forgotten that tactic.

Lucifer—Satan—still follows the same pattern. Scripture describes it plainly:

> *“But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death.”*  
—James 1:14–15

Satan uses the lust that already dwells within us to entice us. Rarely all at once. Usually in fragments. A thought. A glance. A passing idea. Then slowly—almost imperceptibly—something more. Desire. A lingering gaze. A rationalization. A plan. Until a line is crossed and action follows.

He repeats this process patiently, with varying degrees of success. And when an attempt fails, he is not discouraged. He has learned that we are often slow to resist temptation—even when we are established in the church, even when worship is part of our regular rhythm. So he continues his subtle assault.

He knows that with each successful temptation, something within us feels damaged. A corner of the temple seems marred. A beam feels weakened. Slowly, the place from which we worship begins to feel compromised.

Over time, life becomes unmanageable. Worship, once free and honest, becomes forced. Empty. What once flowed now feels strained. And desperation quietly settles in. Our love for God, once vibrant, seems distant—cold.

It can feel as though our temple has been destroyed. Defiled. As though we have been completely subdued.

Or have we?

We possess something Israel did not yet have: the completed Word of God—and the finished work of Christ. The blood of Jesus.

At any point in this battle, we may turn back to Christ. We may remember that His blood has fully covered our sin. We may be restored—not gradually, not partially, but truly. And by the grace of God, the Holy Spirit begins again the work of renewal. This is not a one-time mercy. It is a daily one. Sometimes a mercy we must receive many times a day.

In this sense, we are not passive victims in the struggle. Though the battle is the Lord’s, He has given us weapons to take up—truth, repentance, confession, and grace.

Because of Christ, our temple cannot be destroyed. It can only *appear* damaged to us. As believers, our sin no longer breaks our standing with God. It breaks us against the goodness of His law—but it does not undo our salvation. When we believe otherwise, we have believed a lie.

Nothing essential has changed. We are still His. What changes is our vision. Sin clouds our sight. Grace restores it.

My salvation is secure. Satan may succeed in tripping me, but I will not fall away—because Christ walks with me, holds me, and keeps me on the path.

I am not subdued.

## A Prayer

Faithful God,  
Do not let me make peace with sin,  
and do not let me doubt Your grace.

When I stumble, draw me quickly back to You.  
When shame whispers that I am ruined,  
remind me that I am redeemed.

Teach me to hate what wounds my soul  
without forgetting the mercy that heals it.  
Keep my worship alive, my conscience tender,  
and my confidence anchored in Christ alone.

Amen.

> *“The steps of a man are established by the LORD,  
And He delights in his way.  
When he falls, he will not be hurled headlong,  
Because the LORD is the One who holds his hand.”* **—Psalms 37:23-24**

**My reflection on this passage while in confinement:**  
*4/7/2024*

> *"God does not only pave the path. He guides each and every step to keep me moving in the right direction.*  

> *God takes pleasure in every detail about my life.*  

> *God sees every detail of my life in the light of eternity.*  

> *What may seem like a failed exam to me is only a misused punctuation to Him.*  

> *While this season may seem like a total failure to me, in God’s eyes I merely stubbed my toe.*  

> *I may feel as though I am lying on my back looking up at the rest of the world, when in reality, God is supporting me as I regain my confidence in His plan and goodness.*  

> *God has got this.*  

> *We still have eternity before us."*

**My thoughts today:**  
*2/25/2026*

God led me into jail. At the time, it did not feel like grace. But the reality is: God lovingly tore me out of a life that I had refused to walk away from. In leading me to jail, He was setting me free.

> If you are in a place that feels like confinement — whether physical, emotional, or spiritual — it may not be evidence of His absence. It may be evidence of His intervention.

It was while incarcerated that I began to experience the truth of His delight in my ways. As I immersed myself in His Word, I began to see the world through different eyes. His eyes. And slowly, He showed me how He sees me. Not as I appear in the mirror, but how I fit in eternity. I am His child. His creation. And He loves me. Far more completely than I love my children.

When I fell, I was injured, but I wasn’t destroyed. Instead, God used the occasion of my fall to give me new life. A different kind of life. A forward-looking, optimistic, faith-led life.

> And you are not destroyed either. The fall may feel final in the moment. This is where Psalm 37 becomes personal. The fall is not fatal when Jesus is holding your hand.

God did not abandon me when it seemed to me that all was lost.

Instead, He held me close and allowed me to finally experience true freedom — from behind bars.

God’s leading is not as a guide walking ahead of me. It’s not even as a friend walking beside me. But as a loving Father, gently holding my hand. Both for guidance and for comfort.

> Maybe you have been looking for God far out ahead of you — waiting for a sign in the distance. But what if He is closer than that? What if He has never let go of your hand?

And together, we will make it home.

> If you are lying on your back today — ashamed, confused, or afraid — look up. You may discover that you have not been hurled headlong after all. You may find that the hand still holding yours is the same hand that created you, and calls you His child.

Conceived in trouble  
Brought forth in pain  
Delivered in hope  
Reared in faith  

Consumed by despair  
No comfort found  

Life seemed hopeless  
But You were there all the time  
Where could I turn?  
But You were there all the time  

How many times, O Lord?  
How many times have You shown me  
And I closed my eyes  
How many times have You called  
But I stopped my ears  

You’ve surrounded me; You’ve hemmed me in  
But I shook You off; I chased my sin  
I groped in darkness unable to win  
You offered grace again and again  

Prayer was lifted  
The answer was, “Yes”  

Come alive in me

    <p><em>When the holy place is defiled and left in ruins, God does not abandon it—He rebuilds His dwelling within us with greater glory than before.</em></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“O God, the nations have invaded your inheritance;<br>
they have defiled your holy temple.”</em><br>
—Psalm 79:1</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="from-ashes-to-glory-rebuilding-the-temple-within" tabindex="-1">From Ashes to Glory: Rebuilding the Temple Within</h2>
<p>The invasion of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon’s Temple shattered the soul of a nation. The Temple wasn’t just a building—it was the heartbeat of Jewish life. Perched atop the highest hill, it could be seen for miles, a beacon of divine presence and national pride. Within its walls, between the cherubim in the Holy of Holies, dwelled the very presence of God. Every Jew made pilgrimages to Jerusalem for the annual feasts, offering sacrifices and seeking communion with the Almighty.</p>
<p>But by the time Babylon’s armies breached the city, the people had long abandoned their covenant. They bowed to foreign gods, embraced the idols of surrounding nations, and ignored the prophets who cried out for repentance. For centuries, God had warned them: turn back or face the consequences. His patience was vast, His mercy deep—but eventually, judgment came. The Temple was burned to the ground. The people were carried into exile. And Jerusalem, once the city of God, was left in ruins.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God?”</em><br>
—1 Corinthians 6:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Today, there is a new kind of Temple. One not built of cedar, marble, gold, or bronze—but of flesh and spirit. We are that Temple. You. Me. Every believer. No longer do we travel to meet God in a building; He dwells within us. His Spirit goes where we go. We are never apart from Him.</p>
<p>And yet, like Israel of old, we chase after lesser gods—gods of finance, pleasure, relationships, and distraction. Jesus warned us in the parable of the scattered seed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The seed falling among the thorns refers to someone who hears the word, but the worries of this life and the deceitfulness of wealth choke the word, making it unfruitful.”</em><br>
—Matthew 13:22</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I know this truth well. I was that seed among the thorns. I chased money, music, cars, tools, and sin. Again and again, God called me to return—but I didn’t listen. I gave the enemy easy access to my mind through unchecked desires. Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the Temple that was me fell into ruin.</p>
<p>Until one day, I looked around and realized the truth: evil had defiled the holy place. My life lay in ruins.</p>
<p>But God is faithful. In my despair, I turned to His Word, and He called out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Give careful thought to your ways. Go up into the mountains and bring down timber and build my house, so that I may take pleasure in it and be honored.”</em><br>
—Haggai 1:7–8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There, I found a blueprint for restoration. I began doing what I could—returning to Scripture, prayer, fasting, and service—not to earn restoration, but to respond to grace. And I trusted God to do what only He could do: rebuild the Temple.</p>
<p>He is still at work in me. Not merely repairing what was broken, but constructing something new. Something radiant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“‘The glory of this present house will be greater than the glory of the former house,’ says the LORD Almighty. ‘And in this place I will grant peace,’ declares the LORD Almighty.”</em><br>
—Haggai 2:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is His promise.<br>
It is my hope.<br>
And if you are standing amid ruins today, that promise was spoken with you in mind.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, I confess that I have allowed other things to take Your place in my life.<br>
Forgive me for chasing after idols and neglecting the temple that is my heart.<br>
Come and rebuild what is broken in me.<br>
Fill me again with Your Spirit, so that my life may bring You honor and reflect Your glory.<br>
May the glory of this present house truly be greater than the former.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>God does not merely restore what was ruined—<strong>He rebuilds with greater glory, deeper peace, and lasting presence.</strong></p>

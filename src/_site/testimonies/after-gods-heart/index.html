  <h1>After God’s Heart</h1>

  
    <p><em>David’s life reveals that being ‘after God’s heart’ is not about sinless perfection, but about a heart that repents, returns, and rests in God’s sufficient grace.</em></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“After He had removed him, He raised up David to be their king, concerning whom He also testified and said, ‘I HAVE FOUND DAVID the son of Jesse, A MAN AFTER MY HEART, who will do all My will.’”</em><br>
—Acts 13:22</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”</em><br>
—1 Samuel 16:7</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="after-gods-heart" tabindex="-1">After God’s Heart</h2>
<h3 id="the-paradox-of-david" tabindex="-1">The Paradox of David</h3>
<p>“All My will?”</p>
<p>David’s record does not immediately affirm that claim.<br>
He was passive with Joab (2 Samuel 3:27), reckless with the Ark (2 Samuel 6:1–7), and grievously sinful in his encounter with Bathsheba—marked by complacency, lust, deception, and murder (2 Samuel 11).</p>
<p>He ignored Amnon’s sin, distanced himself from Absalom, tolerated idol worship (1 Samuel 19:13), and defied God by ordering a census (2 Samuel 24).</p>
<p>How can a man with such a fractured history be held up by God Himself as one who would “do all My will”?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="divine-perspective" tabindex="-1">Divine Perspective</h2>
<p>And yet… God said it.</p>
<p>Because God does not judge as man judges.</p>
<p>God’s declaration about David was not denial of sin, nor indulgence of failure. It was a divine, eternal assessment of the heart beneath the behavior. God saw not only David’s falls, but the direction of his life—his reflex to return, repent, and realign himself with God.</p>
<p>Throughout the books of Kings, David becomes the standard—not because he was flawless, but because his heart consistently turned back toward the Lord.</p>
<p>When David sinned, he did not justify, conceal, or harden himself.<br>
He broke.<br>
He confessed.<br>
He returned.</p>
<p>Psalm 51 is not the prayer of a man defending himself, but of one undone by grace. And God restored him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="grace-in-weakness" tabindex="-1">Grace in Weakness</h2>
<p>This pattern is not unique to David.</p>
<ul>
<li>Paul’s thorn was not punishment—it was grace (2 Corinthians 12:7–10).</li>
<li>Job’s suffering was not evidence of guilt—it was a divine testimony of integrity (Job 1–2).</li>
<li>David’s restoration was not earned—it was received.</li>
</ul>
<p>God has always worked this way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“You formed my inward parts; You wove me in my mother’s womb.”</em><br>
—Psalm 139:13</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God knows us completely. He is not surprised by our weaknesses. He is not confused by our limitations. Even what we perceive as flaws exists within the scope of His sovereign design.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="playing-the-hand-were-dealt" tabindex="-1">Playing the Hand We’re Dealt</h2>
<p>It is as if God has dealt each of us a hand—strengths, weaknesses, wounds, tendencies.</p>
<p>He knows every card.</p>
<p>So when we come to Him frustrated over repeated failure, He does not rage against us. His anger is directed at what sin does <em>to</em> us—not at us as His children.</p>
<p>His grace does not deny responsibility, but it refuses shame as the final word.</p>
<p>David played his hand imperfectly—but faithfully.<br>
Not because he never fell, but because he always returned.</p>
<p>To be “after God’s heart” is not to live without sin.<br>
It is to live without hiding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Merciful Father, thank You that You look beyond outward appearances and see the heart. Thank You that You know me completely, including my weaknesses, and that Your grace is sufficient for all of it. Forgive me for the times I despair over my failures or try to hide them from You. Shape in me a heart that quickly repents, consistently returns, and rests fully in Your mercy.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="takeaway-thought" tabindex="-1">Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Being “after God’s heart” is not about flawless obedience, but about a heart that keeps turning back to Him—again and again—resting in grace rather than hiding in shame.</p>

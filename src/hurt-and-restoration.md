## Hurt and Restoration

Brokenness comes to us all—sometimes suddenly, sometimes slowly. We carry hurts from betrayal, loss, failure, abuse, or simply from living in a fractured world. And yet, there is a God who draws near to the broken, who does not demand we be whole before we come to Him.

This collection gathers writings about the honest naming of our wounds and the patient, tender work of restoration—not the kind that erases our scars, but the kind that gives them meaning, that transforms suffering into a language of grace.

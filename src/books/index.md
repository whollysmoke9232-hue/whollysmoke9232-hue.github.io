# Books by Steve Wilkins

## [Margins: Where God Begins](/books/margins-where-god-begins/)

Before the first word of Scripture was written, God already knew the story.

In this deeply personal and theologically rich reflection, Steve invites you into the sacred space before Genesis 1:1—the margin where God's eternal plan was already alive. Drawing from a season of intense Scripture immersion and spiritual awakening, *Margins: Where God Begins* explores the wonder of God's omnipresence, foreknowledge, and intimate involvement in every detail of our lives.

This book is not just a study. It's an invitation to slow down, to look again, and to live in the margin—where God begins.

## [Fractured Light](/books/fractured-light/)

A testimony of brokenness, mercy, and the quiet work of God in the darkest places—where grace refracts through what has been shattered.

*Fractured Light* is a personal testimony—written from seasons of failure, loss, incarceration, homelessness, and deep spiritual reckoning. It is not a story of arriving, but of being met. Not a record of triumph, but of grace breaking through places where light seemed least likely to reach.

The light that remains is not our own. It is His.

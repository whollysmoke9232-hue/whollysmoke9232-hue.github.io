## About the Book

There are stories that are told from a distance.  
And there are stories that can only be told from within the fracture.

*Fractured Light* is a personal testimony—written from seasons of failure, loss, incarceration, homelessness, and deep spiritual reckoning. It is not a story of arriving, but of being met. Not a record of triumph, but of grace breaking through places where light seemed least likely to reach.

This book does not attempt to justify the past or soften its consequences. It bears honest witness to them. And it testifies to something greater still: that even in the darkest moments, God remains present, purposeful, and faithful.

The light that remains is not our own.  
It is His.

## How to Read

This book is not meant to be consumed quickly.

Some chapters may feel heavy. Others may feel familiar. You may recognize parts of your own story in these pages—even if the details are different. It may be helpful to read slowly, to pause often, and to return to certain sections after time has passed.

This is not a book that demands agreement.  
It is a book that invites honesty.

## A Note to the Reader

Some of the reflections in this book were written during incarceration. Others were written in the long aftermath—while navigating loss, estrangement, uncertainty, and rebuilding. The setting matters, but it does not define the whole.

This is not a story about prison.

It is a story about mercy.

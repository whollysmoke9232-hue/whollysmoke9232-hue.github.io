She was the answer to my prayer.

Beautiful. Godly. Kind.

We met in church. We courted with intention. We worshiped together.

She made me want to be a better man.

And I believed the lie:

Marriage will fix me.

Intimacy will heal me.

Love will override lust.

But it didn't.

The shame I carried made intimacy almost impossible.

It warped my view of her.

It warped her view of herself.

I could see it. I could feel it.

And I hated myself for it.

But I still couldn't change it.

So I did what I always did:

I dove deeper into my addiction.

Magazines. Fantasies. Acting out.

Not just physical. Not just psychological.

Spiritual.

Jesus said, "Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin."

And I was practicing.

Daily. Secretly. Desperately.

I convinced myself:

- She'll never know.
- It's not hurting anyone.
- I'll stop soon.

But she did know.

It was hurting her.

And I didn't stop.

The addiction spread like mold.

It warped my relationships.

My identity.

My sense of reality.

I stopped seeing her as a soul.

I started seeing her as a solution.

And when she couldn't fix me, I blamed her.

Marriage didn't heal me.

It exposed me.

## Biblical Parallel: Hosea 1–3

**Love That Won't Let Go**

God told Hosea to marry a prostitute.

Not to shame her.

To love her.

She left him.

Again and again.

She returned to her old lovers.

She sold herself.

And Hosea didn't rage.

He pursued her.

He bought her back.

He spoke tenderly to her.

He said, "You are mine."

Not because she was faithful.

Because he was.

Hosea's love wasn't blind.

It was relentless.

And God said, "This is how I love Israel."

This is how I love you.

## Reflection: Love Isn't the Cure—Grace Is

Marriage is beautiful.

But it's not a cure.

It's a mirror.

It reflects what's hidden.

It magnifies what's broken.

It reveals what needs grace.

My wife loved me.

But she couldn't heal me.

Only God could.

And He didn't abandon me.

Even when I abandoned her.

Even when I abandoned myself.

God's love isn't sentimental.

It's sacrificial.

It's stubborn.

It's holy.

Like Hosea, He pursues.

He redeems.

He whispers, "You are mine."

## Invitation

If you've believed the lie that love will fix you—let grace speak louder.

Write down the expectations you placed on others to heal you.

Then write what only God can do.

Ask Him to love you like Hosea.

To pursue you.

To redeem you.

To whisper, "You are mine."

Because grace doesn't wait for you to be whole.

It meets you in the fracture.

I didn't set out to write this book. I set out to survive.

For decades, I lived in the margins—of society, of church, of my own soul. Addiction carved deep grooves into my life, and shame made sure I stayed hidden in them. I lost friendships, ministry, reputation, and nearly my family. I lost myself. And yet, somehow, I didn't lose God.

This book is not a triumph story wrapped in a bow. It's a testimony. It's the sound of grace echoing through the wreckage. It's the flicker of light that found me in jail, in addiction, in silence—and refused to go out.

The title *Fractured Light* comes from a truth I've come to believe: that God's light doesn't only shine through the polished and the whole. It shines through the broken. Through the cracks. Through the places we try hardest to hide. And when it does, it doesn't just illuminate—it heals.

Each chapter in this book pairs a piece of my story with a story from Scripture. Not to draw perfect parallels, but to show that brokenness is not a modern problem—and redemption is not a modern invention. God has always done His best work in the margins. In the lives of adulterers, addicts, outcasts, and doubters. In the lives of people like me. People like you.

You'll read about my early exposure to sexual addiction, my descent into secrecy and shame, my arrest, my time in jail, and the slow, sacred process of spiritual resurrection. You'll also walk alongside David, Elijah, Hosea, the bleeding woman, and the prodigal son. Their stories aren't sanitized. They're messy. But they're holy. Because God met them there.

If you're reading this and feel like you've gone too far—you haven't.

If your secrets scream louder than your prayers—He hears you.

If you think redemption is for the clean or the worthy—let my life remind you otherwise.

This book is for the ones who feel unseen.

For the ones who feel unworthy.

For the ones who think God has moved on.

He hasn't.

He's still speaking.

Still redeeming.

Still shining fractured light through fractured lives.

Welcome to the margins.

This is where resurrection begins.

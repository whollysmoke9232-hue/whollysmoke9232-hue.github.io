## About the Book

What's your favorite place in the Bible?

Is it a verse? A passage? A chapter? Maybe a book? For some, it's John 3:16. For others, the nativity. Still others are drawn to the resurrection, the Psalms, the prophets, or the letters of Paul.

This book invites you to a different kind of attention—not to the words themselves, but to what comes before them. The margin before Genesis. The pause before creation. The space where God already knew.

*Margins: Where God Begins* is a contemplative journey through Scripture, exploring how God works in the waiting, the silence, the in-between places where His plan unfolds with purpose and precision. It's an invitation to slow down, to look again, and to wonder at the God who has always been present—even before the story began.

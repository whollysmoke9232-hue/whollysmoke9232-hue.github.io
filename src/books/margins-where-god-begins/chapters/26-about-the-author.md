Steve Wilkins is a follower of Jesus, a lifelong student of Scripture, and a storyteller shaped by grace.

After decades of walking with Christ through ministry, failure, restoration, and renewal, Steve entered a profound season of stillness that would forever change how he read the Bible—and how he understood God. During that time, he read Scripture cover to cover fourteen times in twenty-two months, immersing himself in the Word not for answers alone, but for encounter. What emerged was a deep awareness of God’s eternal presence, intentional design, and unwavering faithfulness—a vision that gave birth to *Margins: Where God Begins*.

Steve writes not as a theologian looking down from the lectern, but as a fellow traveler learning to rest in the spaces between certainty and mystery. His reflections are shaped by years of pastoral ministry, personal loss, unexpected detours, and moments when God revealed Himself most clearly in silence rather than spectacle.

At the heart of Steve’s writing is a simple conviction: God is not reacting to our lives—He is revealing Himself through them. We are not striving toward completion; we are awakening to what has already been finished in Christ.

Steve lives with a deep love for Scripture, a reverence for honest questions, and a passion for helping others recognize God’s presence in the ordinary, the overlooked, and the margins of life. When he’s not reading or writing, he can often be found quietly listening—trusting that God still speaks, and that wonder is still a holy response.

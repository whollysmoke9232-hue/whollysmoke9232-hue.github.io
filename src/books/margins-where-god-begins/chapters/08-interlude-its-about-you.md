<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

O God, this isn’t about me at all;  
it is about You.  
It has always been about You.  
You alone.

How could I think that any of this was for me?

All of this is to bring You glory.

I can’t see the end.  
I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.  
Men will turn to You.  
They will know that You alone are God.

It is You who rescues.  
You who redeems.  
You who lifts my soul from the grave.

My life is in Your hands.  
There is nowhere I would rather be.

> *“Because for Your sake I have borne reproach;  
> dishonor has covered my face.”*  
> —Psalm 69:7

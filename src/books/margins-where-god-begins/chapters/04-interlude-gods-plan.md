<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

Throughout my life, I’ve been on a road. Along this road, there have been countless events and encounters—each one shaping me, preparing me for something still ahead.

Cause and effect.

The beauty of cause and effect is that every effect becomes a new cause, setting something else in motion.

God has a plan for me. A path I’m meant to follow. But here’s the challenge: I don’t know what’s coming. I can’t see the next bend in the road, let alone prepare for it. That’s why my path is rarely a straight line.

Every detour is necessary.

Some are gentle curves. Others are sharp turns—painful, even jarring. But I’m learning that these detours are not delays. They are divine preparations.

God knows what lies ahead, and He knows what I’ll need when I get there. The lessons I learn in the detour are the tools I’ll need for the next destination.

And then, that destination becomes the next preparation.

So I’m learning to stop fighting.  
To stop trying to escape the hard places.  
I’m learning to be present.  
To live in the moment.  
And to leave what’s next in God’s hands.

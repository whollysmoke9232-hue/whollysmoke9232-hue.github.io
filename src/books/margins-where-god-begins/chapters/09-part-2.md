If the eternal margin reveals who God is before time began,  
the unfolding margin reveals how He moves within time.

This section explores how God speaks, pauses, and unfolds His purposes—not all at once, but moment by moment, invitation by invitation.

Here, we learn that the margin is not static.  
It is alive.

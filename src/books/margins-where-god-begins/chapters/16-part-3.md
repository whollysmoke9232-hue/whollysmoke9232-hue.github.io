If the eternal margin reveals who God is,  
and the unfolding margin shows how He moves,  
then the living margin is where we respond.

This section explores what it means to live fully aware of God’s presence—not someday, not when everything makes sense, but right here, right now.

The margin is no longer just something we observe.  
It is something we inhabit.

“The heavens declare the glory of God... They have no speech, they use no words; their voice is not heard.”  
—Psalm 19:1–3

This morning, as I read Psalm 19, a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship, I found my gaze drifting out my window. Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward. A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.

I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork. How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze. Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall. This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.

But then, the scene shifted. The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently. It was as though they were waving directly at me. Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement—or was it a dance?—all seemed to be acknowledging my presence. As if to say, “We know you're still there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, ‘Good morning!’”

In that moment, I was utterly overcome. Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over. Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father. And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.

So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees. It was a holy moment, a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made. The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:

You are seen.  
You are loved.

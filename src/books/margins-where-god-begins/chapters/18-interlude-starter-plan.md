**“God still speaks.”**

I can’t take credit for this reading plan. It came from the first student I ever mentored in ministry. I’ve used it ever since. And yes—God still speaks.

## Preparing Your Heart

- Set a daily time. Morning, evening, or whenever you’re most focused. The key is consistency and quiet.
- Begin with silence. Still your thoughts. Invite God to speak.
- Pray for openness. Ask Him to write His Word on your heart.
- Don’t worry if you don’t “hear” anything right away. His Word is alive. It’s working in you—whether you feel it or not.

## How to Read

- Don’t read to check a box.
- Don’t read to find something to post or preach.
- Read slowly. Let the words settle. Let your spirit absorb them.

## The Reading Plan

**Daily:** Five Psalms + One Chapter of Proverbs

Use the calendar date to guide your reading:

- On the 1st of the month, read:  
  Psalms 1, 31, 61, 91, 121 + Proverbs 1
- On the 15th:  
  Psalms 15, 45, 75, 105, 135 + Proverbs 15
- Just add 30 to the day’s date to get your five Psalms.
- On the 29th, skip Psalm 119. Save it for months with 31 days.

In one month, you’ll read all 150 Psalms and all 31 chapters of Proverbs. Then repeat.

You might think this would get old. I’ve been doing it—off and on—for over forty years. It’s still fresh. And God still speaks.

## After You Read

- Ask God to establish His Word in your spirit.
- Ask Him to shape you according to His will.
- If you feel a hunger for more, follow it. Expand your reading. There’s no wrong place to start in Scripture.

God promises:

> *“So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;  
> It will not return to Me empty,  
> Without accomplishing what I desire,  
> And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.”*  
> —Isaiah 55:11 (NASB)

So read. Let His Word pour into your heart.

Then celebrate His work in and through you.

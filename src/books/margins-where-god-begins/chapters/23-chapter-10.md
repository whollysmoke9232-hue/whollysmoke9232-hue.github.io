You’ve walked with me through the margins—  
before the beginning,  
through the silence,  
into the Word,  
and across the tapestry of time.

You’ve seen that God is not just the Author of the story—  
He is the space in which the story unfolds.

He is before all things,  
and in Him, all things hold together.

But this isn’t just a theological truth.  
It’s a personal one.

You are not outside of His reach.  
You are not outside of His plan.  
You are not outside of His love.

You are already in the margin.  
Where God lives.

## The Wonder of Being Known

To live in wonder is to live awake.

Awake to the presence of God in the ordinary.  
Awake to the eternal in the everyday.  
Awake to the truth that you are fully known, fully loved, and fully held.

Wonder doesn’t require answers.  
It requires awareness.

It’s not about figuring everything out.  
It’s about standing in awe of the One who already has.

## The Invitation

So here’s the invitation:

Live like you are already in the presence of God—because you are.  
Live like your story is already known—because it is.  
Live like the Word is still speaking—because He is.

Return to the margin often.  
Pause.  
Listen.  
Look again.

Because in that sacred space,  
you’ll find the One who was there before the beginning  
and who will be there beyond the end.

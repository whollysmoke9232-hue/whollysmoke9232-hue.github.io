People often ask, “What is God’s will for my life?”

- Where should I work?
- Who should I marry?
- What is my ministry?
- My friend is headed for trouble—what should I do?
- My marriage is in crisis—what is God saying to me?

These are real questions. Honest questions. But the deeper question is:

**Where are you looking for the answers?**

- In a song?
- In a sermon?
- In advice from a preacher or teacher?

Those things may carry truth. They may even stir your spirit. But they are not the source. They are echoes. Reflections. Sprinkles of truth.

Are you looking in the Word of God?

Are you spending time in the Word—regularly, not just for answers—but to find King Jesus?

## What Do You Believe About the Word?

Do you believe that the Word of God is:

- The very breath of God?
- Living, active, sharper than a two-edged sword?
- Not just a suggestion book, but the blueprint of life?
- Right tonight?
- Right tomorrow?
- Always right?
- A necessity—not a luxury—in your life?

Here’s a simple question:

Can you quote one verse from memory for each year you’ve been a believer?

That’s not a guilt trip. It’s a gut check.

## The Illusion of Reverence

The church is full of people who love the idea of the Word being a daily part of their lives—but never really submit to it.

What if it became illegal to open your Bible?

Many would fight for the right to own one… just to put it back in the closet.

We are spiritually malnourished.

Not because God is mad at us.  
Not because we’ve lost our salvation.  
But because we have neglected His Word.

Let me be clear, you are as righteous and holy as you’ll ever need to be—by the completed work of Jesus, not by how many hours you spend in your Bible.

But still…

There is something wrong if there is nothing wrong with this picture.

## We Are All Students

The truth is, we do study.

We study:

- TV shows
- Sports
- Music
- Stocks
- Politics
- News

We are all students.

The question is: **What are you a student of?**

What is your study focused on? Where do you spend your time?

## The Simplicity of Study

The wonderful thing about Bible study is that all you need is a Bible… and a willingness to study.

Not to impress God.  
Not to earn points.  
But to know Him.  
To hear His voice.  
To align your life with His truth.

📖 **Psalm 119:9–16 (ESV)**

> How can a young man keep his way pure?  
> By guarding it according to your word.  
>  
> With my whole heart I seek you; let me not wander from your commandments!  
>  
> I have storedup your word in my heart, that I might not sin against you.  
Blessed are you, O Lord; teach me your statutes!  
With my lips I declare all the rules of your mouth.  
In the way of your testimonies I delight as much as in all riches.  
I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways.  
I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget your word.

## Reflection: What Are You Feeding On?

- What would change if you treated the Word of God like your daily bread?
- What if you opened it not just for answers, but for relationship?
- What if you stopped waiting for a sign and started reading the Scriptures?

The Word is not just information. It’s transformation.  
It’s not just a book. It’s breath.  
It’s not just history. It’s His voice—alive and speaking today.

## Prayer

Lord,

Your Word is life.  
It is truth.  
It is light in my darkness and strength in my weakness.

Forgive me for treating it like a suggestion book.  
Forgive me for looking everywhere else for answers when You’ve already spoken.

Give me a hunger for Your Word.  
Not just to read it, but to live it.  
To store it in my heart.  
To meditate on it.  
To delight in it.

Let Your Word shape my thoughts, my choices, my relationships, and my calling.  
Let it be the foundation I build my life on.

In Jesus’ name,  
Amen.

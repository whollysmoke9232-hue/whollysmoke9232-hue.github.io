<div style="text-align:center; font-style: italic;">

The blood of Christ was sufficient to pay the penalty for every lie you ever told or will tell, every sin you ever committed or will commit, every person you ever hurt or will hurt, every lustful thought or action you’ve ever had or will have, every greedy or angry thought you’ve ever had or will have, and every betrayal you ever perpetrated or will perpetrate. It’s not just your past that has been legally covered; it’s your present and future. When Jesus said on the cross, “It is finished,” it was finished… all of it.

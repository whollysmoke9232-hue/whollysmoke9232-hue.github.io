<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.  
I’ve seen Your hand.  
I’ve experienced a taste of Your love.  
I’ve been given a glimpse of Your glory.  
But I want to see more of You.

Purify my heart.  
Cleanse me.  
Reveal my sin.  
Burn away my chaff.  
I desire a deep cleansing.

Create in me a clean heart – a new heart  
So that all that is left standing in me is You.

I don’t want to remember my sin.  
I don’t want to long for sinful things.  
I seek You.  
I seek Your will – Your perfect will.  
Fix my mind in innocence,  
My imagination in purity.  
Lead me in truth.  
Steady me with Your hand.

You are all I need.  
You are all I want.  
O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.

“Jesus said, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.’”  
—Matthew 5:8

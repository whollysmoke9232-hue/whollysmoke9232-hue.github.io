If there was a margin before the beginning,  
then there is also a margin before the end.

We often think of eternity as something that begins after we die. But eternity doesn’t begin—it simply continues. It has no starting point and no expiration. It is the atmosphere of God Himself.

And just as we were held in the margin before Genesis 1:1, we are being drawn toward the margin before Revelation 22:21—the space before the new beginning.

## The End That Is Really a Beginning

The final words of Scripture are not a conclusion. They are a doorway.

> “He who testifies to these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming soon.’ Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.  
> The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.”  
> —Revelation 22:20–21 (NIV)

That’s not the end of the story. It’s the doorway to forever.

The same God who stood in the margin before creation now stands in the margin before consummation. And He is calling us forward—not into an ending, but into fullness. When we arrive in heaven, we will realize that we have been there all along.

## Already and Not Yet

We live in the tension of the “already and not yet.”

Christ has already won the victory, but we have not yet seen its full unveiling.  
We are already seated with Him in heavenly places, but we are not yet home.  
We are already redeemed, but not yet glorified.

This is the final margin—the space between promise and fulfillment.

And just like the margin before Genesis, it is filled with purpose.

## The Hope That Anchors

> “We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain…”  
> —Hebrews 6:19 (NIV)

Hope is not wishful thinking. It’s not a vague optimism. It’s an anchor—tethered to the One who already stands at the end of the story.

He is not waiting to see how it all turns out.  
He already knows.  
He already reigns.  
He is already victorious.

And He is drawing us toward that victory, thread by thread, moment by moment.

## The Margin of Glory

One day, we will step into that final margin.

We will see Him as He is.  
We will know as we are fully known.  
We will realize that we were never outside of eternity—we were always within it.

And all the margins of our lives—the waiting, the wondering, the wandering—will make sense.

They will be woven into the glory of the One who was, and is, and is to come.

## Reflection

What does it mean to live with the end in view?

How would your life change if you believed that eternity is not just ahead of you, but already within you?

You are not waiting for Heaven to begin.  
You are walking toward the fullness of what has always been.

## Prayer

Jesus, You are the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end. Thank You for holding my life between those two points. Help me to live with eternity in my heart, with hope as my anchor, and with trust in the One who already stands at the end of the story. Draw me into the final margin, where all things are made new. Amen.

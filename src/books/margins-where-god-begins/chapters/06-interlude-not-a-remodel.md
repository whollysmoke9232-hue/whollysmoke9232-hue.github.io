<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">

Soon after I invited Jesus into my life, I expected Him to come in and remodel my house.

It made sense. After all, He built me in the first place—He knew where all the plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and structural strengths and weaknesses were. Who better to do the renovations?

But I soon learned He wasn’t interested in a simple remodel.

He began tearing out walls.  
Adding rooms.  
Building wings.  
Raising new levels.

And then it hit me:

The house He was building wasn’t for me at all.

He was building me into something far greater—  
A beautiful, spacious mansion…  
Fit for a King.

He is transforming me into “… a temple of the Holy Spirit.”

—1 Corinthians 6:19 (NIV)

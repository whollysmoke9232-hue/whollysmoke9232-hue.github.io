    intro: >
      Each piece was written in response to something lived, observed,
      read, or endured — often without any thought of where it might
      belong later. Over time, themes began to emerge, and the
      collections you see here were formed organically, after the fact.

          questions, and grace that have shaped this work.


  about-the-author:
    title: Get to Know the Author
    intro: >
      Grace in the Margins was born from a life lived in small moments—ordinary
      encounters, quiet struggles, and the recurring discovery that God's
      presence is most palpable when we are most aware of our own smallness.

      These writings are not offered as answers, but as witness.

      If you’re not sure where to begin, these guided reading paths are offered
      as companions, not instructions.

      Choose the path that best reflects where you are right now.
      There is no right order. There is no rush.

      Some readings appear in more than one path because certain truths meet us
      in many seasons.

  bondage-and-release:
    title: Bondage and Release
    intro: >
      In every life, there are chains we craft ourselves and chains imposed
      upon us. Some are visible—circumstances, relationships, systems that
      constrain us. Others are invisible—beliefs we've internalized, patterns
      we've inherited, weights we carry without naming them as burdens.

      This collection explores the recognition of bondage and the slow,
      sometimes surprising work of being released from it—not through our
      own strength, but through grace that meets us in captivity and opens
      locked doors over time.

  hurt-and-restoration:
    title: Hurt and Restoration
    intro: >
      Brokenness comes to us all—sometimes suddenly, sometimes slowly.
      We carry hurts from betrayal, loss, failure, abuse, or simply from
      living in a fractured world. And yet, there is a God who draws near
      to the broken, who does not demand we be whole before we come to Him.

      This collection gathers writings about the honest naming of our
      wounds and the patient, tender work of restoration—not the kind
      that erases scars, but the kind that gives them meaning.

  weariness-and-renewal:
    title: Weariness and Renewal
    intro: >
      There is a weariness that settles into the bones—not mere tiredness,
      but a deep fatigue of spirit that comes from long seasons of struggle,
      from bearing what feels unbearable, from the slow erosion of hope.
      Yet there is also renewal—not the kind that denies the weariness,
      but the kind that meets us in it.

      This collection explores the valley of exhaustion and the quiet,
      persistent grace that whispers of rest, refreshment, and the strength
      to take one more step when we have nothing left to give.

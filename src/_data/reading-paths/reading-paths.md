      Grace in the Margins was born from a life lived in small moments—ordinary
      encounters, quiet struggles, and the recurring discovery that God's
      presence is most palpable when we are most aware of our own smallness.

      These writings are not offered as answers, but as witness. They come from a
      life devoted to paying attention, to finding meaning in the margins, to
      believing that the small matters because the small is where most of us
      actually live.

      Each piece was written in response to something lived, observed,
      read, or endured — often without any thought of where it might
      belong later. Over time, themes began to emerge, and the
      collections you see here were formed organically, after the fact.

          These writings are for those caught in patterns they cannot
          seem to escape, offering honesty without condemnation and
          hope without shortcuts.

          These writings speak gently to harm, betrayal, and loss,
          without minimizing pain or rushing healing.

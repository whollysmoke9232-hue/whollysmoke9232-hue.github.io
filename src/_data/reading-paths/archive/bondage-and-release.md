## Bondage and Release

In every life, there are chains we craft ourselves and chains imposed upon us. Some are visible—circumstances, relationships, systems that constrain us. Others are invisible—beliefs we've internalized, patterns we've inherited, weights we carry without naming them as burdens.

This collection explores the recognition of bondage and the slow, sometimes surprising work of being released from it. Not through our own strength, but through the grace that meets us in our captivity and slowly opens every locked door.

This site exists because faith does not always grow in clean places.

Some people meet God in sanctuaries, with steady lives and predictable rhythms.  
Others meet Him in the margins—in failure, in loss, in addiction, in prison cells, in grief, in waiting rooms, and in the long aftermath of consequences we cannot undo.

This is a place for the second group.  
Not because they are better—but because they are honest.

Grace in the Margins is a collection of devotionals, reflections, meditations, stories, and testimonies written from lived faith—not theoretical belief. These writings come from years of wrestling with Scripture while standing in places I never planned to stand. They come from sobriety, repentance, unanswered prayers, and the slow work of learning to trust God when relief does not come quickly—or at all.

You will not find easy answers here.  
You will not find denial, hype, or spiritual shortcuts.

What you will find is this:

A God who is not embarrassed by broken people  
A faith that survives when outcomes are uncertain  
A gospel that still holds when everything else has been stripped away  

The margins are not where God abandons us.  
They are often where He does His deepest work.

These writings are not meant to impress.  
They are meant to accompany—to sit with you in the questions, to point again and again to Christ, and to remind you that obedience, hope, and worship are still possible—even here.

If you are strong, welcome.  
If you are tired, welcome.  
If you are ashamed, unsure, or waiting longer than you think you can endure—you are not alone.

This is grace in the margins.

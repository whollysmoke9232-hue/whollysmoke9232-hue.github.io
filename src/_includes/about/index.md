  <h2>Grace in the Margins</h2>

  <p>
    This space was born from a deep conviction: that God is not absent in life’s interruptions, 
    but profoundly present. Whether in silence, suffering, failure, or long seasons of waiting, 
    His sovereignty is at work—quietly weaving redemption into stories that feel unfinished.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Grace in the Margins</strong> is a place for honest, Scripture-rooted reflection. 
    These devotionals, meditations, and testimonies are written from lived faith—not theory—shaped by repentance, 
    endurance, unanswered prayers, and the slow work of grace. This is theology formed in real places, 
    where God meets us not after the struggle, but within it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here, you’ll find an invitation to see your life through the lens of eternity, 
    to trust God’s presence in the margins, and to believe that even what feels wasted 
    can become a place of restoration, clarity, and hope.

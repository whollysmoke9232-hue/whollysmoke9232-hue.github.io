I believe God is not threatened by human weakness, nor surprised by failure. Scripture shows again and again that God works not around weakness, but through it. Our limitations, wounds, and habitual struggles are not interruptions to God’s purposes; they are often the very soil in which grace takes root.

God does not measure faithfulness by flawlessness. He looks at the direction of the heart, not the absence of scars. Like David, we are known not by the sins that trip us, but by our willingness to return—to repent, to trust mercy, and to keep walking with God in honesty.

Weakness humbles us, strips away illusion, and teaches us dependence. It becomes the place where God’s strength is most visible and His compassion most believable. Ministry that flows from weakness is not polished, but it is true—and truth is what heals.

This is not an excuse for sin, nor a denial of responsibility. It is a confession that grace is deeper than our failure, and that God remains faithful even when we stumble. God redeems broken people not by erasing their weakness, but by transforming it into a testimony of His steadfast love.

### A Prayer

Faithful God,  
I bring You not my strength, but my need.  
Not my certainty, but my dependence.  
Meet me in the places where I feel exposed,  
where my weakness has stripped away illusion  
and left me with nothing to offer but honesty.

Teach me to trust that You are at work  
even here—especially here.  
Shape my failure into humility,  
my weakness into compassion,  
and my scars into quiet testimony  
of Your patient, steadfast love.

Help me to keep returning.  
To keep walking.  
To believe that Your grace is deeper  
than all the ways I fall short.


Amen.

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,<br>
the moon and the stars, which You have ordained;<br>
what is man that You take thought of him,<br>
and the son of man that You care for him?”</em><br>
—Psalm 8:3–4</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Of all the things to consider, the psalmist looks up at the heavens.<br>
He doesn’t look at his problems, his enemies, or his own strength.<br>
He looks at the vast, silent, majestic work of God’s fingers—the moon and the stars, set in their perfect courses.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-question-of-scale" tabindex="-1">A Question of Scale</h2>
<p>Have you ever done that? Stood outside on a clear night, away from the city lights, and just looked up?</p>
<p>The sheer scale of it all is humbling. You see pinpricks of light from suns that are trillions of miles away, some of which may have already died long before their light reached your eyes. Faced with such cosmic grandeur, it is almost impossible not to feel small—insignificant.</p>
<p>This is exactly where David’s heart goes. After marveling at the universe, his focus snaps back to himself, and he asks one of the most profound questions in all of Scripture:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“What is man that You take thought of him?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words:<br>
<em>God, after creating all of this—galaxies, nebulae, black holes, worlds without number—why would You spend even a second thinking about me?</em></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-astonishing-answer" tabindex="-1">The Astonishing Answer</h2>
<p>The miracle of the Gospel is the answer to David’s question.</p>
<p>Our value is not determined by our size or our place in the cosmos.<br>
Our significance is measured by the attention of the Creator.</p>
<p>God’s creative work was not merely a display of power; it was personal. The psalmist describes the heavens as the work of God’s <em>fingers</em>—the language of an artist’s intimate touch, not a ruler’s distant command.</p>
<p>And the same careful attention God gave to ordaining the stars is directed toward you.</p>
<p>The God who knows every star by name also knows the number of hairs on your head.<br>
The God who orchestrates the dance of galaxies also bends down to listen to your quietest prayer.</p>
<p>You are not an afterthought.<br>
You are not a cosmic accident.<br>
You are a deliberate thought in the mind of God—someone He actively <em>takes thought of</em> and deeply <em>cares for</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>When you feel overlooked, anonymous, or insignificant today, look up.</p>
<p>Remember that the same God who hung the stars in the sky has, in an act of breathtaking love, set His focus and His affection on you.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You for the humbling majesty of Your creation.<br>
When I feel small and forgotten, remind me that I am seen and cared for by You—the Maker of the heavens.<br>
Help me to find my true value not in myself, but in Your astonishing love for me.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p>Your worth is not measured by how big the universe is—but by how closely God holds you within it.</p>

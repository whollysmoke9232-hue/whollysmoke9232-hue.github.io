<blockquote>
<p><em>“For You created my inmost being;<br>

I praise You because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.”</em><br>

<h2 id="the-story" tabindex="-1">The Story</h2>
<p>Before a single piece of wood was cut, the pantry existed in my mind.<br>
I knew its purpose, how it needed to function, and the beauty I envisioned for it.<br>
I drew up the plans, gathered the materials, and the sawdust began to fly.</p>
<p>In the beginning, anyone visiting my workshop would have seen only a pile of random boards and a mountain of sawdust.<br>
To an outsider, it didn’t look much like a pantry. But to me, it already was.</p>
<p>Slowly, I began gluing boards into panels, shaping and smoothing them.<br>
Soon, the prepared parts were arranged in neat stacks.<br>
Still, to a visitor, it was just an organized collection of wood.<br>
But I could see the finished product with perfect clarity.</p>
<p>Next came the detailed work: cutting the joints, fabricating the mechanisms for adjustable shelves and soft-close drawers.<br>
Then, assembly. Finally, it looked like a pantry.<br>
But the most time-consuming work had just begun.</p>
<p>The sanding and smoothing process took longer than all the previous steps combined.<br>
During this phase, a casual observer might grow impatient, because the progress being made wasn’t always obvious to anyone but me.</p>
<p>Lastly, the finish was applied—multiple coats of paint and protective sealer, each followed by patient buffing with steel wool and a soft cloth.<br>
This stage took even longer than the sanding.<br>
The onlooker might wonder, <em>“Why is this taking so long? It already looks finished!”</em><br>
But I knew it still required these final layers of preparation and protection to fulfill the purpose for which it was being built.</p>
<p>When it was complete, I was filled with pride.<br>
The doors opened and closed perfectly, the shelves adjusted effortlessly, and the drawers whispered as they moved.<br>
When we set it in place and filled it with groceries, utensils, and keepsakes, my joy soared.</p>
<p>In time, the pantry began to show signs of a well-used life—dents and dings, scratches from the dog, chipped paint from the constant traffic of a large family.<br>
I could see every imperfection it collected.<br>
But none of them lessened the pride and joy I felt every time I saw it.</p>
<p>I loved that pantry, not because it was perfect, but because I had created it.</p>
<p>Nothing that happened to it could ever change the way I saw it,<br>
for it had grown from a vision that started deep in my heart.<br>
Its purpose mattered far more than its flaws.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="divine-perspective" tabindex="-1">Divine Perspective</h2>
<p>And isn’t this how our Creator sees us?</p>
<p>The psalmist David captures this divine perspective beautifully in Psalm 139.<br>
God knows us completely. He formed us intentionally. He saw us before we were finished—and loved us fully before we ever failed.</p>
<p>Just as I see the pantry not as a collection of flaws but as the fulfillment of a vision, so God sees us.<br>
He sees the dents and dings we collect through life—our mistakes, our heartaches, our failures.<br>
He is intimately aware of every imperfection.</p>
<p>Yet none of them diminish His love.</p>
<p>He loves us simply because we are His.<br>
We are His workmanship—born from a vision of love deep in His heart—and nothing can ever change that.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="in-the-hard-seasons" tabindex="-1">In the Hard Seasons</h2>
<p>You may be walking through a season of hardship, pain, or disappointment.<br>
In those moments, it can feel as though God has grown distant.</p>
<p>But those are often the very seasons when He is sanding, shaping, and finishing.<br>
He has not stepped away.<br>
He is still working with care.</p>
<p>Today, be loved.<br>
Be accepted.<br>
Be who you were created to be—dents, dings, scratches, and all.</p>
<p>You were prepared for a purpose.</p>

<p><strong>How might your perspective change today if you truly saw yourself as God’s beloved workmanship—designed with purpose, imperfections included?</strong></p>

<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Heavenly Father, thank You for seeing us not for our flaws, but as Your wonderful work.<br>
Help us rest in the truth that we are fearfully and wonderfully made,<br>
created with intention, and loved unconditionally by You.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

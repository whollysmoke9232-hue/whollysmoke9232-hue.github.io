  <h1>All Things</h1>

  
    <p><em>Life does not always come together in ways we can understand. Faith holds to the promise that God is at work even when meaning feels hidden, and nothing is ultimately wasted.</em></p>

  <p>“I will cry to God Most High,<br>
To God who accomplishes all things for me.” —Psalm 57:2</p>
<p>God who accomplishes <em>all things</em> for me. [the phrase appears in italics in some English translations] I generally approach those italics with caution. The words in italic are not in the Hebrew manuscript. They were inserted by the translators for clarification – to allow the text to make sense to an English speaking reader.</p>
<p>So I dove into the Hebrew to see what was actually there. What I found surprised me. “All things” is exactly what the original text is conveying. The Hebrew is absolute. Its distilled meaning is to complete, to finish, to bring to an end—to carry through to fulfillment. David is putting all of his marbles in God’s jar. He is saying;</p>
<p>This is not the story of my perseverance, but of the God who completes what concerns me. He is also the One who begins it—who turns my feet toward the path, directs my steps, protects me along the way, heals the brokenness caused by my inconsistent  following, and brings me safely to the destination. It is all Him, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>David is declaring that he is ultimately powerless to effect lasting change in his life (which, by the way, is the first of the twelve steps in <em>Alcoholics Anonymous</em>). He has learned that effort can be sincere and still insufficient; obedience can be real and still powerless; and insight does not equal transformation. He still prays, fights, and obeys, but he knows that the ultimate outcome is out of his control.</p>
<p>There is much to learn from David’s example here. My waiting for God to work is not passive. It is active. I pray about the things that concern me. I strive to live a life that will be pleasing to God. I saturate my mind with the Word of God. I evaluate my progress by the fruit of the Spirit. But I don’t trust any of those things to accomplish the victory that God has promised. Only He can do that. And He does. So whatever ultimately comes to completion in my life, God—not my effort—is the one who accomplishes it.</p>
<p>This is not the story of my perseverance, but of the God who begins, carries, heals, and completes what concerns me—from beginning to end.</p>
<p>&quot;For I am confident of this very thing, that He who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus” —Philippians 1:6</p>

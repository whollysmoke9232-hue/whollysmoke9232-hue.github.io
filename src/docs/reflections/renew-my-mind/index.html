  <h2 id="renew-my-mind" tabindex="-1">Renew My Mind</h2>
<p><strong>Romans 12:2</strong><br>
“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect.”</p>
<p>The world we live in has a powerful way of shaping how we think—often without our permission.</p>
<p>In America, our culture has long been obsessed with appearance, particularly body image. From an early age, we are surrounded by images that present an “ideal” version of beauty. That ideal is rarely subtle. It is curated, exaggerated, sexualized, and relentlessly repeated. It appears on our screens, in advertisements, in entertainment, and now—more than ever—through social media and digital platforms that follow us everywhere.</p>
<p>The message is simple and persistent: this is what it means to be desirable, valuable, and worthy of attention.</p>
<p>For women especially, the pressure has often been severe. The “ideal” body is narrow, unrealistic, and constantly shifting just out of reach. Achieving it—when it happens at all—often comes at the expense of physical health, emotional well-being, and peace of mind. Even then, maintaining it becomes a full-time pursuit, reinforced by editing, filtering, and comparison.</p>
<p>This conditioning begins early. Children absorb it before they have the tools to question it. Characters that fit the ideal are celebrated; those who do not are often sidelined, mocked, or reduced to caricatures. Over time, we learn—quietly but effectively—what earns approval and what does not.</p>
<p>Men, including well-meaning and sincere men of faith, are not neutral observers in this process. Too often, we reinforce the very standards we claim to reject. We say that appearance does not define worth, that love is not conditional, that beauty runs deeper than the surface— and then we turn around and give our attention, admiration, and desire to the very standards we claim to reject—teaching, by our actions, that conformity is the price of being seen. The contradiction speaks louder than our words. It teaches conformity, not freedom.</p>
<p>The problem is not simply cultural; it is spiritual.</p>
<p>First, the image we are chasing is not real. It is constructed, managed, and sustained through resources most people do not have—and were never meant to need. We were not created to live that way.</p>
<p>Second, it is not biblical.</p>
<p>Scripture does not define beauty by measurements, proportions, or presentation. God’s concern has never been centered on outward appearance, but on the condition of the heart. He desires wholeness, health, and integrity—not so that we might be admired, but so that we might be available. We need healthy bodies and minds because we have been called to love, to serve, and to carry His presence into the lives of others.</p>
<p>God calls us outward—toward compassion, awareness, and attentiveness to the needs and wounds around us. Yet constant preoccupation with appearance inevitably turns us inward. When our energy is consumed with managing how we are seen, little remains for seeing others well.</p>
<p>This was never God’s intention.</p>
<p>So how do we change?</p>
<p>We begin by acknowledging how much time, effort, and emotional energy we have spent trying to conform—to meet expectations that were never rooted in truth. And then, slowly and deliberately, we turn toward transformation.</p>
<p>Transformation begins in the mind.</p>
<p>Renewing the mind is not about force or perfection. It is about replacement—about making room for truth where lies have taken up residence. Scripture offers us something the world cannot: a stable, trustworthy voice that speaks to who we are, not how we appear.</p>
<p>Start simply.</p>
<p>Spend time in the Word. Read it. Sit with it. Let it speak without rushing to master it. Memorize passages that reorient your heart toward God’s priorities—verses that remind you of His nearness, His grace, and His purposes.</p>
<p>“Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness…” (Matthew 6:33)<br>
“There is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.” (Romans 8:1)<br>
“Nothing can separate us from the love of God…” (Romans 8:38–39)</p>
<p>Find rhythms that help anchor you in truth. Consistency matters more than volume. The goal is not to crowd your mind with information, but to shape it with what is real.</p>
<p>The world is loud. It speaks constantly. And when we are tired, distracted, or discouraged, its voice becomes easier to believe.</p>
<p>Renewing the mind is an ongoing act of trust—choosing, again and again, to listen to God over the noise, to rest in His definition of worth, and to allow His truth to slowly untangle what the world has twisted.</p>
<h2 id="a-closing-prayer" tabindex="-1">A Closing Prayer</h2>
<p>Father,<br>
Today I ask You to guard my mind and gently redirect my thoughts.<br>
Help me recognize the voices that pull me away from You,<br>
and give me the grace to return—again and again—to what is true.<br>
Renew my mind, not through striving, but through Your presence.<br>
Teach me to see myself and others through Your eyes.<br>
Amen.</p>

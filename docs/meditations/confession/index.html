  <h1>Confession</h1>

  
    <p><em>Forgiveness is freely given in Christ, yet many of us continue to live under guilt. Psalm 51 reminds us that confession is not groveling before an angry God, but returning to a gracious Father who has always been ready to restore.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p><em>Author’s note: This is not about how to get forgiven. It’s about learning to live like you already are.</em></p>
<p>I’m a sinner. I suspect you are, too. As such, we all want and need forgiveness, which thankfully is offered freely through the blood of Jesus.</p>
<p>However, in my life I’m aware that there is a difference between <em>being</em> forgiven and living as though I <em>know</em> I’m forgiven. I still tend to linger in guilt and shame over my transgression long after I’ve been forgiven.</p>
<p>I simply cannot believe that God intends that we continue to carry the burden of our sin after He paid such a price to purchase our freedom.</p>
<p>So I return to Psalm 51.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Be gracious to me, O God, according to Your lovingkindness;<br>
According to the greatness of Your compassion blot out my transgressions.</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+51:1&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psalms 51:1</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David knew a thing or two about forgiveness and freedom. We would do well to consider and follow his example.</p>
<p>He begins by asking for grace. This is important to remember as we progress through this Psalm. David makes some bold pronouncements and requests; but they are all based on the foundation of God’s grace. David understands that he could do nothing to earn God’s favor. He can only trust God to be consistent in His action toward David. He identifies this as grace.</p>
<p>David immediately qualifies this request with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>according to Your lovingkindness;<br>
According to the greatness of Your compassion</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>David is not reminding God of His lovingkindness and compassion. He’s reminding himself.</p>
<p>In our sin, our focus quickly changes from our Father to our failure. We begin to see the whole world through the lens of shame and disappointment. Without immediate correction, we will begin to believe the lie that all is hopelessness and despair.</p>
<p>It seems critical in the confession of our sin to God that we remember Who we are talking to. More importantly, who we are not talking to.</p>
<p>We are not talking to a God who is waiting impatiently for us to realize that we deserve the punishment that is surely headed our way. We are kneeling before a God who patiently waited for us to run to Him so we could be restored.</p>
<p>As Christians, we naturally read this Psalm in the light of Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf. We must remember that David offered this prayer centuries before Jesus. And it is evident through the rest of David’s writing that he believed his prayers were answered.</p>
<p>That phrase, blot out my transgressions, seems so New Testament.</p>
<p>For me, that is what makes this Psalm so powerful.</p>
<p>The grace, mercy, and forgiveness of God didn’t suddenly appear with the advent of Christ.</p>
<p><em><strong>God does not change.</strong></em></p>
<p>We are not walking on new, thin ice when we seek forgiveness and restoration from our Heavenly Father. We are leaning on traits that have been part of God’s character since before time.</p>
<p>God has always been quick to forgive and restore. That’s in His nature. It’s part of who He is.</p>
<p>When we come before God with our confession of sin, we need not be timid or fearful. He is not mad at us.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>He is more ready to forgive us than we are to ask.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

  <h1>Created In His Image</h1>

  
    <p><em>A reflection on whether the cross was an interruption in the story of creation or the meaning creation was always built to reveal.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p>What came first, the chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>Do we instinctively protect our eyes so David could write,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Keep me as the apple of the eye;”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalms+17:8&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psalms 17:8</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was David inspired only after the Spirit observed humanity guarding this fragile part of the body? Did our protection of the eye simply become a metaphor for covenant love — or did God have David’s heart in mind when He created the eye?</p>
<p>Did God create reality with metaphors already inside it?</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder why we were made with certain features. Because we were created in Their image — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Do we have arms so Jesus could be suspended by nails through His wrists?</p>
<p>What came first — Christ’s body, our creation, or the crucifixion?</p>
<p>We usually read Genesis like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God → makes man → later becomes like man</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what if we were made in the image of the God who would become human and be crucified?</p>
<p>The template may not be Adam, but the incarnate Christ — the wounded, resurrected human already present in the mind of God.</p>
<p>From inside time we see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>creation → incarnation → crucifixion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But from outside time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christ → cross → creation built to hold it</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cross may not interrupt the story.</p>
<p>It may be the center the story was built around.</p>
<p>Creation becomes a stage shaped for redemption.</p>
<p>So the cross does not use the body — the cross reveals what the body always meant.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hands were always for giving.<br>
Skin always for bearing.<br>
Eyes always for guarding.<br>
Life always for offering.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Creation is not arranged around future events. It reflects the character of the One who made it.</p>
<p>So when the cross happens, it does not feel foreign to the world — it fits it.</p>
<p>Not prediction, but coherence.</p>
<p>It may be that humanity was not designed merely to live,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>but to reveal the kind of God who gives Himself.</p>
</blockquote>

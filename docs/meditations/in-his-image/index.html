    <p><em>What does it mean to be made in the image of a holy God? A meditation on eternity in fragile bodies and the longing for unending communion with the Infinite One.</em></p>

  <h2 id="in-his-image" tabindex="-1">In His Image</h2>
<p>Something that amazes me...</p>
<p>We are made in God’s infinite image.</p>
<p>I have “known” and believed that for most of my life. But I’ve rarely considered what it implies about who I am and why I’m here.<br>
God is holy. We are often profane. He is omnipotent. Omniscient. We are dirty. Common. So how do we reconcile the two? How can a decidedly imperfect creature contain the image of a holy God?</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness;</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+1:26&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genesis 1:26</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>We are created in His <em>image</em> — not like Him.</p>
<p>We are given eternal existence, which means that our souls do not cease. How can that be? Finite creatures who will live forever? What a paradox.</p>
<p>We are offered eternal life as a gift. God is eternal by nature.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He has “set eternity in the human heart.”</em> <strong>— <a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ecclesiastes+3:11&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ecclesiastes 3:11</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because we are created in His image, there is something in us that longs for eternity.</p>
<p>What a thought! We are designed for unending communion with the Infinite One.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For now we see in a mirror dimly…”</em> <strong>— <a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13:12&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Corinthians 13:12</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because of our finite bodies, we are incapable of grasping the reality of infinite. We go through life searching for understanding of this mystery.</p>
<p>From time to time, we get a glimpse - a minuscule understanding of something beyond us.  Of the eternal God. Of our fallen nature. Some truth we discover, but can’t quite vocalize.</p>
<p>These excite us but leave us uneasy. We know we’ve tapped into something eternal, but we can’t quite grasp it.</p>
<p>As we make these discoveries, we share them with others - who are incapable of comprehending what we are trying to explain – because, like us, they are finite creatures who carry eternity in fragile bodies.</p>
<p>Each of these “holy moments” becomes the unseen building blocks for a faith that we can’t explain.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is a part of us that longs for the infinite — because we were made for eternal communion with the Infinite One. But our union seems fragile. We feel that we are unable to sustain any lasting intimacy.</p>
<p>One day, after we shed the finite limitations of these bodies, we will finally embrace the fullness of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>We will see Him as He is</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+John+3:2&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 John 3:2</a></strong><br>
<em>We will know fully as we are fully known</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+13:12&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Corinthians 13:12</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the Infinite can never be exhausted by the finite.</p>
<p>Even in eternity, we will endlessly discover Him. We will share the wonder of the four beings that spend eternity in His presence and never stop proclaiming his inexpressible holiness <em>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+4:8&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Revelation 4:8</a>)</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, we were created to be His image bearers. And while I don’t understand all that means, I intend to spend the rest of my life leaning into it.</p>

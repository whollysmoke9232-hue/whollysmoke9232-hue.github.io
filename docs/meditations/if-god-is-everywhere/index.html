  <h1>If God Is Everywhere All The Time…</h1>

  
    <p><em>God’s omnipresence means we are never outside His presence or purposes. This meditation explores identity, rest, and belonging in a God who is always near.</em></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Where can I go from Your Spirit?<br>
Or where can I flee from Your presence?”</em><br>
—Psalm 139:7 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>If God is everywhere, then I do not merely walk with Him—I exist within Him. I breathe in His presence, and He breathes through mine.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then “as far as the east is from the west” is still within His embrace. There is no exile from His love, no distance from His gaze.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then He sees me as I am, as I was, and as I will be—all at once. Not in sequence, but in fullness. Not in progress, but in completion.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then He knows everything that can be known about me—and infinitely more. The things I hide, the things I fear, the things I don’t yet understand about myself—He holds them all without flinching.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then what I call an obstacle is both there and not there. It is real in my time, but resolved in His. It is a shadow cast by a light I haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then He is not “working on me.” He has already finished. I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then all of my current and future problems have already been solved. All of my questions already answered. I am not waiting for clarity—I am walking toward it.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then maybe when I get to Heaven, I’ll realize I’ve been there all along. That eternity was never a destination, but a dimension I was always tethered to.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then even my sins and weaknesses will become stained-glass windows—broken pieces made beautiful by the light of His grace.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then the power that created galaxies and raised Jesus from the grave dwells in me. Not metaphorically. Literally.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then I am connected to everything—because everything exists within Him. Every atom, every angel, every moment, every miracle.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere, then nothing is impossible for me. Because nothing is impossible for Him. And He is not just beside me—He is in me. And I am in Him.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, expand my awareness of Your nearness. Help me to rest in the truth that I am never outside Your presence, never beyond Your reach, and never unseen by Your love. Teach me to live from that reality, with trust, humility, and awe.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

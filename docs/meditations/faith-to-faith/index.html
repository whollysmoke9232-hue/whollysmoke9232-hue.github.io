  <h1>Faith to Faith</h1>

  
    <p><em>The righteousness that saves us is credited by God, received by faith, and lived out by faith—from beginning to end.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p><strong>Romans 1:17</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith…”</em><br>
—Romans 1:17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This righteousness is not achieved—it is credited.<br>
It is the righteousness that God places into our account by faith.</p>
<p>There is nothing I can do to earn this righteousness.<br>
It is given freely, received by faith alone.</p>
<p>It begins with faith,<br>
produces faith,<br>
and ends with faith.</p>
<p>And it requires nothing more than faith the size of a mustard seed.</p>
<p>Faith is all we bring to the table at salvation—<strong>justification</strong>.<br>
Faith is also the goal of our lives after salvation—<strong>sanctification</strong>.</p>
<p>By faith, our lives are gradually transformed into the image of Christ Jesus, as we apply what He has revealed through His Word.</p>
<p>And even this faith is not self-generated.</p>
<p>Faith itself is a gift—given by the Holy Spirit.</p>

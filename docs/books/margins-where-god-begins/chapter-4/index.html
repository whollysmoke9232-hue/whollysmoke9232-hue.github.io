  <!-- Main chapter content -->
  <main class="main-page">
    <p>Before there was light, there was the Word.<br>
Before there was time, there was the Word.<br>
Before there was a beginning, there was the Word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made;<br>
without Him nothing was made that has been made.”<br>
—John 1:1–3 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>John doesn’t start his gospel with a manger. He starts with eternity. He takes us back—not just to Genesis 1:1, but to the margin before it. And there, in that eternal space, we find Jesus.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="christ-before-creation" tabindex="-1">Christ Before Creation</h2>
<p>Jesus didn’t begin in Bethlehem. He didn’t begin in Mary’s womb. He didn’t begin at all. He always was.</p>
<p>He is the Word before the Word.</p>
<p>The One who spoke creation into existence. The One who walked with Adam, wrestled with Jacob, and appeared in the fire with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The pre-incarnate Christ was always present—always active—always central to the story.</p>
<p>And then, He stepped into the story He authored.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-word-became-flesh" tabindex="-1">The Word Became Flesh</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.”<br>
—John 1:14 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eternal became temporal. The infinite became touchable. The Author became a character in His own story—not to observe, but to redeem.</p>
<p>This is the mystery of the incarnation: that the One who existed before time entered time. That the One who created the world allowed Himself to be born into it. That the Word who spoke stars into being would one day cry out in anguish on a cross.</p>
<p>And He did it for love.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-voice-that-still-speaks" tabindex="-1">The Voice That Still Speaks</h2>
<p>The Word didn’t stop speaking after creation. He still speaks.</p>
<p>He speaks through Scripture. Through the Spirit. Through family, friends, and others. Through the quiet moments when your heart is still enough to hear Him. He speaks in the margins of your life—the spaces between the noise, the pauses between the plans.</p>
<p>And when He speaks, things change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword…”<br>
—Hebrews 4:12 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same Word that created the universe is now at work in you. Not as a distant echo, but as a living presence.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-word-in-you" tabindex="-1">The Word in You</h2>
<p>If Christ is the Word, and the Word lives in you, then you carry eternity within you. You carry the voice that calmed storms, cast out demons, and called Lazarus from the grave. You carry the very power of creation.</p>
<p>You carry the Word that was before the beginning.</p>
<p>And that Word is still creating. Still restoring. Still calling things into being that are not as though they were.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What does it mean to you that Jesus existed before creation?</p>
<p>How does it change your view of Him—not just as Savior, but as the eternal Word?</p>
<p>You are not following a man who lived and died.<br>
You are following the Word who always was and always will be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Jesus, You are the Word before the Word. The voice that spoke creation into being. The light that darkness cannot overcome. Thank You for stepping into time to redeem what You created. Speak into my life again. Remind me that You are not just in my story—you are the One who wrote it. Amen.</p>

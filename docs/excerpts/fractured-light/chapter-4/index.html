  <h1>Fractured Light: The Altar</h1>

  

  
    <p><strong>By Steve Wilkins</strong></p>
  

  
</header>

<article class="article-content">
  <p>There wasn't an altar call.</p>
<p>No persuasive speech.</p>
<p>No emotional invitation.</p>
<p>Just music.</p>
<p>Just truth.</p>
<p>Just the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>It was a Keith Green concert. I remember it like it was yesterday. I remember the song. I remember the crowd. I remember the moment—standing at the edge of the stage, overwhelmed by conviction. I had been playing games with God. And He wasn't amused.</p>
<p>I wasn't just addicted. I was divided.</p>
<p>I wanted God—but I wanted my sin too.</p>
<p>I wanted forgiveness—but I didn't want surrender.</p>
<p>That night, everything changed.</p>
<p>I prayed: &quot;Father, I don't want to be interested in any other girl until I meet the one I will marry.&quot;</p>
<p>And I wasn't.</p>
<p>The weeks that followed were electric.</p>
<p>Bible studies. Worship gatherings. Mid-week services.</p>
<p>New friends. Godly friends.</p>
<p>No drugs. No sex. Just transformation.</p>
<p>I was living in light for the first time.</p>
<p>Then I met her.</p>
<p>The answer to my prayer.</p>
<p>She made me want to be a better Christian. A better man.</p>
<p>We courted. We worshiped. We dreamed.</p>
<p>But the spiral wasn't gone.</p>
<p>It was waiting.</p>
<p>I began fantasizing about her.</p>
<p>Then acting out those fantasies.</p>
<p>Then acting out.</p>
<p>Then guilt.</p>
<p>Then shame.</p>
<p>Then prayer.</p>
<p>Then recommitment.</p>
<p>The cycle had returned.</p>
<p>Familiar. Unforgiving.</p>
<p>We talked. We tried to stop.</p>
<p>But I couldn't.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned how addiction rewires the brain.</p>
<p>How dopamine depletion drives darker desires.</p>
<p>How spiritual slavery isn't just metaphor—it's reality.</p>
<p>Jesus said, &quot;Everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin.&quot; (<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8:34&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 8:34</a>)</p>
<p>That was me.</p>
<p>Even after the altar.</p>
<p>Even after the prayer.</p>
<p>Even after the transformation.</p>
<p>I was still enslaved.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-parallel-isaiahs-vision" tabindex="-1">Biblical Parallel: Isaiah's Vision</h2>
<p><strong>Isaiah 6: Conviction and Calling</strong></p>
<p>Isaiah was in the temple.</p>
<p>Worshiping. Seeking. Waiting.</p>
<p>Then the heavens opened.</p>
<p>He saw the Lord—high and exalted.</p>
<p>Angels cried, &quot;Holy, holy, holy.&quot;</p>
<p>And Isaiah didn't celebrate.</p>
<p>He collapsed.</p>
<p>&quot;Woe to me!&quot; he cried. &quot;I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips…&quot;</p>
<p>Conviction.</p>
<p>Not condemnation.</p>
<p>Not shame.</p>
<p>Just truth.</p>
<p>Then came the coal.</p>
<p>A burning ember from the altar.</p>
<p>Touched to his lips.</p>
<p>Cleansing. Healing. Commissioning.</p>
<p>&quot;Your guilt is taken away,&quot; the angel said. &quot;Your sin is atoned for.&quot;</p>
<p>Then came the call:</p>
<p>&quot;Whom shall I send?&quot;</p>
<p>And Isaiah replied, &quot;Here am I. Send me.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="reflection-the-altar-is-a-beginning" tabindex="-1">Reflection: The Altar Is a Beginning</h2>
<p>The altar isn't the end of the spiral.</p>
<p>It's the beginning of surrender.</p>
<p>Isaiah didn't walk away perfect.</p>
<p>He walked away commissioned.</p>
<p>I didn't leave that concert healed.</p>
<p>I left it awakened.</p>
<p>Conviction isn't shame—it's invitation.</p>
<p>To be cleansed.</p>
<p>To be called.</p>
<p>To be changed.</p>
<p>God doesn't wait for us to be ready.</p>
<p>He meets us in the moment.</p>
<p>He touches the unclean.</p>
<p>He speaks through the broken.</p>
<p>And He sends us.</p>
<h2 id="invitation-return-to-the-altar" tabindex="-1">Invitation: Return to the Altar</h2>
<p>Where did God first meet you?</p>
<p>Where did conviction first break through?</p>
<p>Return there.</p>
<p>Not to relive shame—but to remember grace.</p>
<p>Write a prayer of surrender.</p>
<p>Name the sin.</p>
<p>Ask for the coal.</p>
<p>Ask for the cleansing.</p>
<p>Then ask for the calling.</p>
<p>Because the altar isn't where you end.</p>
<p>It's where you begin.</p>

  <h1>Fractured Light: The Spiral</h1>

  

  
    <p><strong>By Steve Wilkins</strong></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p>Adolescence didn't slow the spiral—it accelerated it.</p>
<p>By high school, acting out had become a daily ritual. Fantasies fueled by magazines, memories, and stories kept me hungry. And high school offered new fuel: girls who were just as curious, just as broken, just as eager to explore.</p>
<p>It started innocently enough—go steady, see how far I could go. But when one girl had had enough, I moved on. I wasn't looking for love. I was looking for access. And each encounter became another rung in the spiral.</p>
<p>I'd act out.</p>
<p>Feel guilt.</p>
<p>Cry out for forgiveness.</p>
<p>Promise to stop.</p>
<p>Then do it again.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found a girl willing to go all the way. And even that didn't satisfy. It only deepened the fantasy. The acting out. The shame. The cycle.</p>
<p>Fear of pregnancy. Fear of getting caught. Conviction of sin. None of it could break the grip.</p>
<p>We broke up—and so did my heart. But I didn't grieve. I medicated. Another girl. Then another. And on and on it went.</p>
<p>Then something shifted. A spiritual stirring. A hunger for God. I started reading my Bible. Leading in youth group. Seeking righteousness. <a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:33&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:33</a> became my anchor: &quot;Seek first His kingdom…&quot;</p>
<p>But even as I pressed into God, the spiral didn't stop.</p>
<p>It just got quieter.</p>
<p>More deceptive.</p>
<p>More spiritual.</p>
<p>I couldn't admire a girl without objectifying her. I couldn't separate beauty from lust. I had stopped seeing souls. I only saw parts.</p>
<p>By graduation, I was in a full-on tailspin.</p>
<p>I didn't know it yet.</p>
<p>But God did.</p>
<h2 id="biblical-parallel-david-and-bathsheba" tabindex="-1">Biblical Parallel: David and Bathsheba</h2>
<p><strong>2 Samuel 11–12: The Spiral of a King</strong></p>
<p>David was a man after God's own heart.</p>
<p>He wrote psalms. Led armies. Loved God.</p>
<p>But one evening, he saw her.</p>
<p>Bathsheba. Beautiful. Bathing.</p>
<p>And he didn't look away.</p>
<p>He sent for her. Slept with her.</p>
<p>She became pregnant.</p>
<p>So he covered it up.</p>
<p>Then he killed her husband.</p>
<p>The spiral was swift.</p>
<p>Desire.</p>
<p>Deception.</p>
<p>Destruction.</p>
<p>And David, the worshiper, became David, the manipulator.</p>
<p>Until Nathan came.</p>
<p>Until truth pierced the spiral.</p>
<p>Until David broke.</p>
<p>&quot;Against You, and You only, have I sinned,&quot; he cried in Psalm 51.</p>
<p>He didn't blame Bathsheba.</p>
<p>He didn't justify.</p>
<p>He repented.</p>
<p>And God forgave him.</p>
<h2 id="reflection-the-spiral-isnt-the-end" tabindex="-1">Reflection: The Spiral Isn't the End</h2>
<p>Addiction doesn't start with darkness.</p>
<p>It starts with desire.</p>
<p>Desire that becomes distorted.</p>
<p>Distortion that becomes deception.</p>
<p>Deception that becomes destruction.</p>
<p>But the spiral isn't the end.</p>
<p>It's the place where grace waits.</p>
<p>David's story didn't end in shame.</p>
<p>It ended in surrender.</p>
<p>And mine can too.</p>
<p>Yours can too.</p>
<p>God doesn't abandon us in the spiral.</p>
<p>He enters it.</p>
<p>He speaks truth into it.</p>
<p>He offers mercy through it.</p>
<h2 id="invitation-name-your-spiral" tabindex="-1">Invitation: Name Your Spiral</h2>
<p>Where are you spiraling?</p>
<p>What desire has become distortion?</p>
<p>Write it down.</p>
<p>Confess it.</p>
<p>Not to punish yourself—but to break the silence.</p>
<p>Then pray David's prayer:</p>
<p>&quot;Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.&quot; (<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+51:10&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psalm 51:10</a>)</p>
<p>Because the spiral doesn't have to end in shame.</p>
<p>It can end in surrender.</p>

  <h1>Not Even One</h1>

  
    <p><em>When Scripture strips away self-confidence, grace is revealed not as an idea to admire, but as a Person to depend on.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <blockquote>
<p>God has looked down from heaven upon the sons of men<br>
To see if there is anyone who understands,<br>
Who seeks after God.<br>
Every one of them has turned aside; together they have become corrupt;<br>
There is no one who does good, not even one.<br>
—Psalm 53:2–3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no one who does good, not even one.</p>
<p>I tend to get pretty impressed with myself.</p>
<p>When I write, or teach, or preach, or sing…<br>
or even after a conversation with a friend when I have shared some new insight.<br>
I mean, I just did something out of the ordinary.<br>
Something that caused others to stop and listen.<br>
God should be impressed, shouldn’t He?</p>
<p>And for a moment, I forget the Psalm.</p>
<p>I forget that God is not scanning the earth for brilliance, originality, or eloquence.<br>
He is not pausing over my clever phrasing or nodding at my theological precision.<br>
He is not impressed by what makes <em>others</em> lean in.</p>
<p>He is looking for understanding.<br>
And understanding, according to Scripture, is not insight—it is surrender.<br>
It is not articulation—it is dependence.<br>
It is not being right—it is being honest.</p>
<p>The problem is not that I speak about God.<br>
The problem is how quickly I begin to believe that <em>I</em> am doing something good.</p>
<p>Psalm 53 is not an insult to humanity; it is a diagnosis.<br>
Left to myself, even my best moments carry the scent of self-reliance.<br>
Even my “holy” efforts quietly ask to be noticed.<br>
Even my obedience wants credit.</p>
<p>“There is no one who does good, not even one.”<br>
Not because we never do outwardly good things,<br>
but because goodness, in God’s economy, is never self-generated.<br>
It does not rise from insight or effort or sincerity.<br>
It flows only from union.</p>
<p>The moment I am impressed with myself<br>
is the moment I have stopped seeking Him.</p>
<p>And this is the mercy hidden inside the Psalm:<br>
God does not come looking for impressive people.<br>
He comes looking for those who know they are not.</p>
<p>Those who have stopped trying to be seen as good<br>
and have begun to be content with being known.</p>
<p>And yet, the Psalm does not end with despair.</p>
<p>If no one does good—<br>
if no one understands,<br>
if no one truly seeks God—<br>
then the only hope left is that God seeks us.</p>
<p>Which He does.</p>
<p>Grace begins not where effort improves,<br>
but where self-confidence finally collapses.<br>
It begins when I stop mistaking awareness for righteousness<br>
and insight for obedience.</p>
<p>Christ does not enter the story as an example to admire<br>
or a standard to aspire toward.<br>
He enters as the <em>only</em> truly good One—<br>
the One the Psalm was waiting for.</p>
<p>Where I turn aside, He remains faithful.<br>
Where I grasp for credit, He empties Himself.<br>
Where I confuse speaking <em>about</em> God with knowing Him,<br>
He comes near in flesh and blood and silence.</p>
<p>My hope is not that I will someday do good consistently enough<br>
to contradict the Psalm.<br>
My hope is that Christ has already done good completely enough<br>
to fulfill it.</p>
<p>Dependence, then, is not weakness to be overcome.<br>
It is the posture that finally tells the truth.<br>
“I can do nothing apart from You”<br>
is not a spiritual slogan—it is a confession of reality.</p>
<p>And in that confession, grace is no longer theoretical.<br>
It becomes daily bread.<br>
Unearned.<br>
Sustaining.<br>
Enough.</p>
<p>I do not need to impress God.<br>
I need to abide.</p>
<p>That is where goodness begins.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-closing-prayer" tabindex="-1">A Closing Prayer</h3>
<p>Father,<br>
You know how easily I am impressed with myself,<br>
and how quickly I forget that every good thing flows from You.<br>
Strip away my illusions of self-sufficiency.<br>
Teach me to abide rather than perform,<br>
to depend rather than impress,<br>
to be known rather than admired.</p>
<p>Thank You for Jesus—<br>
the only truly good One—<br>
and for grace that meets me not at my best,<br>
but at my most honest.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>

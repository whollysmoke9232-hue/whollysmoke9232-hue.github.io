  <h1>Faith from Beginning to End</h1>

  
    <p><em>Righteousness isn’t earned—it’s credited by faith. From salvation to sanctification, the entire journey is a gift of grace, received through faith from beginning to end.</em></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed—a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ‘The righteous will live by faith.’”</em><br>
—Romans 1:17</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Have you ever felt the weight of trying to be “good enough”?<br>
The relentless striving. The constant measuring. The quiet fear that you never quite measure up.</p>
<p>The gospel cuts through that burden with a liberating truth: the righteousness of God is not something we achieve—it is something He <strong>reveals</strong> and <strong>credits</strong> to our account. A divine deposit given to the undeserving.</p>
<p>That has always been the pattern.</p>
<p>Genesis tells us that Abraham believed God, <em>and it was credited to him as righteousness</em> (Genesis 15:6). Romans echoes the same truth: this righteousness is “by faith from first to last.”</p>
<p>There is nothing we can do—no effort, no discipline, no moral performance—to earn it. At salvation, we bring only one thing to the table: faith. We stop striving and start trusting in what God has already done.</p>
<p>But faith is not only the doorway into life with God.</p>
<p><strong>Faith is the way we walk forward as well.</strong></p>
<p>We walk by faith.<br>
We grow by faith.<br>
We are conformed to the image of Christ by faith.</p>
<p>Our transformation does not come from self-effort, but from an ongoing, responsive faith—one that listens, obeys, and rests in the work of the Holy Spirit. As we open ourselves to God through His Word, prayer, and daily dependence, He does the reshaping from the inside out.</p>
<p>And here is the humbling, freeing truth beneath it all: even faith itself is a gift. We do not manufacture it; the Spirit supplies it. From beginning to end, God is the source.</p>
<p>So release the burden of earning.<br>
Receive the gift you were never meant to pay for.</p>
<p>We live righteous lives not <em>for</em> salvation, but <em>from</em> salvation—by faith, all the way through.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-questions" tabindex="-1">Reflection Questions</h2>
<ol>
<li>What does it mean to you that God’s righteousness is <em>credited</em> to your account rather than earned?</li>
<li>How does seeing faith as both the beginning and the ongoing means of growth change the way you face daily struggles?</li>
<li>Take a moment to thank God—not only for salvation, but for sustaining you by faith today.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You that faith begins with You and continues by You.<br>
Teach me to live from Your righteousness, not toward it.<br>
Keep me grounded not in performance, but in trust—<br>
and let my life be shaped by wonder, not striving.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="takeaway-thought" tabindex="-1">Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Righteousness is not the reward for striving—<br>
it is the gift that carries us by faith from beginning to end.</p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The heavens declare the glory of God…<br>
They have no speech, they use no words;<br>
their voice is not heard.”</em><br>
—Psalm 19:1–3</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="a-morning-encounter" tabindex="-1">A Morning Encounter</h2>
<p>This morning, as I read Psalm 19—a passage that speaks of creation’s silent, ceaseless worship—I found my gaze drifting out the window.</p>
<p>Beyond the fence line stood a cluster of trees, their branches reaching skyward. A gentle breeze stirred, and in an instant, thousands of limbs—laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves—began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.</p>
<p>I paused, contemplating God’s incredible handiwork. How remarkable that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze. Too rigid, and they would snap. Too weak, and they would fall. This balance of strength and grace bears the unmistakable fingerprint of divine wisdom.</p>
<p>Then something shifted.</p>
<p>The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, but suddenly I saw them differently. It was as though they were waving directly at me—thousands of branches, moving in unison, acknowledging my presence. As if to say, <em>“We know you’re still there. We’re still here too. We just wanted to say good morning.”</em></p>
<p>In that moment, I was undone.</p>
<p>Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over. The God who formed galaxies and governed storms had orchestrated this quiet encounter. And there, in the stillness, I felt profoundly loved.</p>
<p>So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back at the trees. It was a holy moment—a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed by the creation He made.</p>
<p>Without words, the message came through clearly:</p>
<p><strong>You are seen. You are loved.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-unspeakable-voice" tabindex="-1">The Unspeakable Voice</h2>
<p>As I reflected on that moment, I was reminded of the Apostle John’s struggle to describe the voice of God in Revelation. Reaching for human language, he offered comparison after comparison:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“…a loud voice like a <strong>trumpet</strong>”</em> —Revelation 1:10</li>
<li><em>“…his voice was like the sound of <strong>rushing waters</strong>”</em> —Revelation 1:15</li>
<li><em>“From the throne came flashes of lightning, rumblings and peals of <strong>thunder</strong>”</em> —Revelation 4:5</li>
<li><em>“…like <strong>harpists playing their harps</strong>”</em> —Revelation 14:2</li>
</ul>
<p>One might be tempted to ask, <em>“Which is it, John—trumpets, thunder, rushing water, or harps?”</em></p>
<p>And I imagine his gentle reply would be, <em>“Yes. Exactly.”</em></p>
<p>God’s voice cannot be contained by a single metaphor. Sometimes it crashes like thunder. Sometimes it roars like oceans. And sometimes—it whispers through leaves waving in the breeze.</p>
<p>Yet the message is always the same.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="eternal-message" tabindex="-1">Eternal Message</h2>
<p>God speaks in countless ways, but His message never changes.</p>
<p><strong>You are loved.</strong></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,<br>
so that whoever believes will in Him have eternal life.”</em><br>
—John 3:14–15</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In the wilderness, the Israelites were dying—bitten by serpents, the consequence of their rebellion. But God, in His mercy, provided a way of healing: a bronze serpent lifted high on a pole. There was no ritual, no sacrifice, no work required. Just one thing: <strong>look</strong>—and <strong>live</strong>.</p>
<p>That moment in Israel’s history was more than a rescue; it was a foreshadowing. Jesus pointed back to it when He said, <em>“Even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”</em> Just as the bronze serpent was raised for healing, Christ would be lifted on the cross for our salvation.</p>
<p>And the invitation remains the same. Not <em>work harder</em>. Not <em>clean yourself up</em>. Not <em>prove you’re worthy</em>. Just <strong>look</strong>. Look to Jesus. Believe. And live.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>We often complicate grace. We try to earn what can only be received. But the gospel is stunning in its simplicity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For God so loved the world…”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That includes you. That includes your mess, your doubts, your failures.</p>
<p>Jesus is the Judge, yes—but He didn’t come to slam the gavel. He came to open the door. The judgment isn’t in His coming; it’s in our response. The Light has come. Will we turn toward it—or away?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord Jesus, thank You for being lifted up for me. I confess that I often try to earn what You’ve already given. Help me to simply look to You in faith. Thank You for loving me before I ever loved You. Today, I choose to believe. I choose to live.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

<p><strong>You don’t climb your way to God or fix yourself first—you simply look to Jesus and live.</strong></p>

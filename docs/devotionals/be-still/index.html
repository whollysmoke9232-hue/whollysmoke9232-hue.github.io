  <h1>Be Still</h1>

  
    <p><em>We chase holiness like a performance, but God meets us in surrender. In the margins of our striving, His grace whispers strength. This devotional invites you to lay down self-effort and discover the power of being still before God.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>_“The LORD of hosts is with us;<br>
The God of Jacob is our stronghold.<br>
Selah.</p>
<p>Come, behold the works of the LORD,<br>
Who has wrought desolations in the earth.<br>
He makes wars to cease to the end of the earth;<br>
He breaks the bow and cuts the spear in two;<br>
He burns the chariots with fire.</p>
<p>‘Cease striving and know that I am God;<br>
I will be exalted among the nations,<br>
I will be exalted in the earth.’</p>
<p>The LORD of hosts is with us;<br>
The God of Jacob is our stronghold.<br>
Selah.”_<br>
—Psalm 46:7–11 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="be-still" tabindex="-1">Be Still</h2>
<p>We rarely admit how hard we try to fix ourselves. We may not say it aloud, but our calendars, prayers, and thoughts betray us—we believe sanctification is a performance. If you are tired of trying to become someone better for God, this reflection is for you.</p>
<p>We think if we work hard enough, pray long enough, read deeply enough, God will surely be pleased. And maybe then we’ll change.</p>
<p>We often live as though sanctification—the process of becoming more like Jesus—is ours to manufacture. We read the latest book, binge hours of sermons, and pour ourselves into avoiding sin, all in an effort to become “holy enough,” as if the phrase <em>God helps those who help themselves</em> were gospel truth.</p>
<p>But Scripture tells a different story.</p>
<p>God helps those who <strong>cannot</strong> help themselves.</p>
<p>In the margins—the divine detours—we find a better way. In these places, our strength finally gives out. We run out of verses to quote and pep talks to rehearse. And it’s there, in the silence, that we hear something ancient:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“When we were still powerless, Christ died for the ungodly… While we were still sinners, Christ died for us.”</em><br>
—Romans 5:6–8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God didn’t wait for us to clean up. He moved toward us while we were helpless. There is something about our surrender that draws Him near.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast.”</em><br>
—Ephesians 2:8–9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God knows our pride. If holiness could be earned, we would take the credit. But He is the One who transforms—and He waits until we stop striving.</p>
<p>It is foolish to believe that lasting change originates with us. God is the Creator and Sustainer of the universe and all it contains. He alone has the wisdom and power to make the changes that truly matter. Even our confidence that we know <em>what</em> needs changing is often rooted in pride.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.”</em><br>
—2 Corinthians 12:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is in our weakness that God’s power flows. Surrender is not quitting—it is the doorway to divine strength.</p>
<p>Those who try to help themselves chase change and find disappointment. But those who are still and know—they find God.</p>
<p>God does not wait for us to help ourselves. He meets us at the edge of our striving and whispers grace into our exhaustion. The margins are where effort ends and surrender begins—not because we’ve given up, but because we’ve finally let go.</p>
<p>In those still places, the miracle begins. Not a performance. Not a reward. A resurrection.</p>
<p>We are invited to work in response to grace—but never to forget that the outcome belongs to Him. We must be about the work God has placed before us, while trusting Him completely with the results.</p>
<p>He does not need our help.<br>
He desires our trust.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>Where are you striving in your own strength today? What sin, fear, or burden have you been trying to fix on your own?</p>
<p>Take a moment to be still. Picture yourself laying down the tools of self-effort at His feet—the worry, the planning, the shame, the frantic work. Exhale your weakness. Inhale His strength.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, forgive me for trusting in my own strength. I confess that I am weak and powerless to change myself. Today, I cease my striving. I choose to be still and know that You are God. Thank You that Your power is made perfect in my weakness. Take control of my struggles, my sins, and my efforts. Be exalted in my life today.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

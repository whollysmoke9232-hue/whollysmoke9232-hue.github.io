    <p><em>The psalms teach us that faith does not move in straight lines—from despair to trust, and from trust to being led again toward God Himself.</em></p>

  <h3 id="from-how-long-to-lead-me-home" tabindex="-1">From How Long to Lead Me Home</h3>
<p><strong>Psalms 13; 43:3</strong></p>
<p>Life in faith is a roller coaster ride.</p>
<p>Abuse.<br>
Addiction.<br>
Arrest.<br>
Jail.<br>
Estrangement from my family.<br>
Homelessness.<br>
Doors closed by background checks—for housing, for work, for stability.</p>
<p>Over and over, I have faced the depths of despair.</p>
<p>Psalm 13 gives language to those moments when prayer feels repetitive and unanswered—<em>How long, O Lord?</em> How long will You forget me? How long will You hide Your face? How long must I carry sorrow in my heart all day long?</p>
<p>This is not polished faith.<br>
It is exhausted faith.<br>
Faith that keeps asking because it has nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>The psalmist does not rush past the anguish. He names it. He lingers there. He allows the ache to speak honestly before God. And yet—almost without warning—the psalm turns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But I have trusted in Your lovingkindness.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not because circumstances changed.<br>
Not because the enemy stopped boasting.<br>
But because God had not stopped being God.</p>
<p>That turn amazes me every time.</p>
<p>My spirit can be crushed one moment and, the next, quietly anchored again in what is still true: I am not abandoned. I am not forgotten. My salvation does not depend on my situation. God has dealt bountifully with me—if not always in comfort, then always in mercy.</p>
<p>I am continually surprised by how quickly my spirit turns—not because life improves, but because God meets me again in the dark and reminds me who He is.</p>
<p>And somehow, once more, I find myself able to sing.</p>
<p>But singing does not mean confusion has vanished.<br>
Trust does not mean the path is suddenly clear.</p>
<p>That is where Psalm 43 gives me my next prayer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“O send out Your light and Your truth, let them lead me;<br>
Let them bring me to Your holy hill<br>
And to Your dwelling places.”</em> —Psalm 43:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is tempting to read this as a prayer for resolution—for a house, a job, restored relationships, or a return to something that once felt stable.</p>
<p>But the psalmist names a different destination.</p>
<p>The light and truth of God are not asked to lead him <em>out</em> of suffering so much as to lead him <em>to</em> God Himself. The holy hill is not a metaphor for success. The dwelling place is not ordinary security. It is the nearness of God—His presence, His reality, His faithfulness.</p>
<p>I have prayed for many outcomes.<br>
Relief.<br>
Restoration.<br>
Vindication.<br>
A way back to what was lost.</p>
<p>Those prayers are not wrong.</p>
<p>But Psalm 43 gently reorients my longing.</p>
<p>The destination is not a house.<br>
Not a job.<br>
Not even reconciliation with my family—precious as that would be.</p>
<p>The destination is God Himself.</p>
<p>If His light leads me, I am not wandering.<br>
If His truth guides me, I am not lost.<br>
And if I arrive in His presence—even with unanswered prayers still in my hands—I have not failed to reach home.</p>
<p>From <em>How long, O Lord?</em><br>
to <em>Lead me.</em></p>
<p>This is the quiet journey of faith—<br>
not a straight line upward,<br>
but a repeated turning back toward the One<br>
who has never stopped being there.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h3>
<p>O Lord, when my prayers are reduced to <em>How long?</em>, teach me to not stop praying.<br>
When my eyes grow dim, enlighten them again with Your light and truth.<br>
Lead me—not merely out of trouble, but into Your presence.<br>
When outcomes remain uncertain and restoration feels distant,<br>
steady my heart in the knowledge that You Yourself are my home.<br>
Amen.</p>

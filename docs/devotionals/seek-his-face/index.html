  <h1>Seek His Face</h1>

  
    <p><em>God desires to be desired—not for what He can give, but for who He is. Psalm 127 reminds us that striving without Him is empty, but seeking Him brings rest and blessing.</em></p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain.<br>
Unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain.<br>
In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat—<br>
for He grants sleep to those He loves.”</em><br>
<strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+127:1&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psalm 127:1</a>–2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>God desires to be desired—not for what He can give, but for who He is. He longs for us to seek His face, not merely His hand.</p>
<p>Too often, our prayers are filled with requests for provision, protection, and promotion. And while God is a generous Father who delights in blessing His children, He never intended for His gifts to replace His presence.</p>
<p>When we chase after blessings, we find ourselves weary, frustrated, and spiritually dry. But when we chase after Him, everything changes.</p>
<p>Psalm 127 reminds us that all our striving is in vain unless the Lord is at the center. We can build, guard, hustle, and grind—but without Him, it’s empty. Yet when we seek Him first, when we make Him our pursuit <em>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:33&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:33</a>)</em>, His blessings follow us—even in our sleep.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="shift-the-focus" tabindex="-1">Shift the Focus</h2>
<p>God doesn’t want to be a means to an end.<br>
He <em>is</em> the end.<br>
He <em>is</em> the reward.</p>
<p>And when we seek Him—not for what He can do, but for who He <em>is</em>—we find rest. We find peace. We find purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-picture-of-blessing" tabindex="-1">A Picture of Blessing</h2>
<p>Psalm 127 goes on to describe children as arrows in the hand of a warrior—a sign of strength, legacy, and divine favor.</p>
<p>But this truth extends beyond children. Every blessing from God—whether it’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Family</li>
<li>Provision</li>
<li>Opportunity</li>
<li>Peace</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>—is ultimately a byproduct of His presence.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we dwell with Him, we walk in confidence—not because of what we have, but because of <em>who is with us</em>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="facing-the-gate" tabindex="-1">Facing the Gate</h2>
<p>The psalm ends with a powerful image: standing before the judges in the gate. These were the authorities, the decision-makers, the ones who could determine your fate. But when you know you’re walking with God, you don’t fear the gate. You don’t fear the verdict.</p>
<p>Because no matter what the world decides, you are held in the hand of the One who reigns above it all.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord, forgive me for the times I’ve sought Your hand more than Your heart.<br>
Teach me to desire You above all else.<br>
Help me to seek Your face daily, to rest in Your presence,<br>
and to trust that every good thing flows from You.<br>
I want to dwell with You—not just visit.<br>
I want to know You—not just need You.<br>
Be my pursuit, my portion, and my peace.<br>
Amen.</p>

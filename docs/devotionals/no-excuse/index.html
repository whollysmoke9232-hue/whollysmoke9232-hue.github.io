    <p><em>God’s revelation is not hidden—it’s everywhere. Creation declares His power, and conscience confirms His nature. The question is not whether He’s spoken, but whether we’ll respond.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—His eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.”</em><br>
—Romans 1:19–20</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>God doesn’t whisper His identity into the cosmos—He shouts it.</p>
<p>Have you ever looked up at a starlit sky and felt an overwhelming sense of wonder? Or marveled at the intricate design of a tiny flower, or the precision of the human eye? According to the Apostle Paul, these moments are more than awe-inspiring—they are revelation.</p>
<p>Creation is God’s signature. The stars, the subatomic particles, the neural pathways in our brains—each bears witness to eternal power and intentional design. The complexity of life speaks of a Creator who is both transcendent and near.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="conscience-confirms" tabindex="-1">Conscience Confirms</h2>
<p>And then there is conscience.</p>
<p>Inside every person is a moral awareness—a recognition of right and wrong that is not merely learned, but known. We don’t always follow it. In fact, we rarely do. But the presence of conscience itself testifies to the imprint of God.</p>
<p>Paul says that <em>“what may be known about God is plain,”</em> not because humanity is clever, but because <strong>God has made it plain</strong>. He has not hidden Himself in a distant realm accessible only to the spiritual elite. He has written His evidence into creation and etched His law onto the human heart.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="divine-evidence" tabindex="-1">Divine Evidence</h2>
<p>God’s <strong>eternal power</strong> is revealed in the vastness of the universe and the precision of the microscopic world. From galaxies to electrons, the sheer scale and order of existence point unmistakably to an omnipotent Creator.</p>
<p>God’s <strong>divine nature</strong> is revealed within us. We intuitively understand justice, fairness, and moral accountability—even when we resist them. This universal moral awareness, though distorted by sin, reflects the character of a holy and righteous God.</p>
<p>Because God has made Himself so clearly known—through creation and conscience—Paul concludes that humanity stands <strong>without excuse</strong>. The evidence is undeniable. The question is not whether God has revealed Himself, but whether we will respond to what has been made plain.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<ol>
<li>Where have you recently seen God’s eternal power displayed—in nature, in Scripture, or in your own life?</li>
<li>How does your conscience affirm what you already know about God’s character?</li>
<li>Knowing that God has made Himself plain, what response is He inviting from you today?</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, thank You for revealing Yourself so clearly—in the skies above, in the intricacies within, and in the quiet convictions of my heart. Help me live not in denial of what I know, but in humble surrender to who You are.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>

<p><strong>God has not hidden Himself—the only question is whether we will listen and respond.</strong></p>

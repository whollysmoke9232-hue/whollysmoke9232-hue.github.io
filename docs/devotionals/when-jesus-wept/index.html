  <h1>When Jesus Wept</h1>

  
    <p><em>The shortest verse in the Bible reveals the depth of Christ’s love and grief over a broken world. Jesus wept—not out of weakness, but out of divine compassion.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Jesus wept.”</em><br>
—John 11:35</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>It’s the shortest verse in the Bible—just two words. And yet, those two words carry the weight of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>“Jesus wept.”</strong></p>
<p>Why would the Son of God—who knew He was about to raise Lazarus from the dead—pause to weep at a tomb?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="back-to-the-beginning" tabindex="-1">Back to the Beginning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“God saw all that He had made, and it was very good.”</em><br>
—Genesis 1:31</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the beginning, there was no death, no sorrow, no brokenness. Creation pulsed with harmony, beauty, and life.</p>
<p>But then came the fall.</p>
<p>Sin entered the world through disobedience, and with it came the curse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Cursed is the ground because of you…”</em><br>
—Genesis 3:17</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From that moment on, everything changed. Sin infected not just human hearts, but the very fabric of creation. Death became a reality. Tears became a language. And the world began to groan under the weight of what was lost.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-grief-of-god" tabindex="-1">The Grief of God</h2>
<p>So when Jesus stood at Lazarus’ tomb and saw Mary weeping, Scripture tells us He was “deeply moved in spirit and troubled.”</p>
<p>The Greek word used here suggests more than sadness—it implies indignation, even outrage.</p>
<p>Jesus wasn’t angry at the people.<br>
He wasn’t angry at their grief.<br>
He was angry at what sin had done.</p>
<p>At the pain.<br>
At the loss.<br>
At the distortion of what was once “very good.”</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-jesus-wept" tabindex="-1">Why Jesus Wept</h2>
<ul>
<li>Jesus wept because this was not how it was supposed to be.</li>
<li>He wept over the sting of death.</li>
<li>He wept over the sorrow of His friends.</li>
<li>He wept over a world broken by sin.</li>
</ul>
<p>And He still weeps today.</p>
<p>Not because He is powerless.<br>
Not because He is surprised.<br>
But because He loves.</p>
<p>And love always grieves what wounds the beloved.</p>
<p>Jesus hates sin—not merely because it is rebellion,<br>
but because of what it does to us.<br>
To His creation.<br>
To His children.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord Jesus, thank You for being a Savior who weeps.<br>
Thank You for feeling the weight of our sorrow and the sting of our brokenness.<br>
Help me to hate sin—not just for what it is, but for what it does.<br>
Give me eyes to see the world as You see it, and a heart that longs for restoration.<br>
May I live in the hope that You are making all things new.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="takeaway-thought" tabindex="-1">Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>Jesus doesn’t just hate sin because it’s rebellion—<br>
He hates it because it breaks what He loves.</p>
<p>And one day, He will wipe away every tear…<br>
<strong>because He wept first.</strong></p>

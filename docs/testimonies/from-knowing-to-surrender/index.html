<article class="article-content">
  <h2 id="a-note-to-the-reader" tabindex="-1">A Note to the Reader</h2>
<p>This is not a story of instant freedom or permanent arrival. It is the record of a slow undoing—of discovering that knowing the truth is not the same as being changed by it. What follows is not a cleaned-up testimony, but an honest account of how surrender moved from theory to lived experience in my life. If there is hope here, it is not in my resolve, but in the grace that met me when my resolve finally ran out.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="from-knowing-to-surrender" tabindex="-1">From Knowing to Surrender</h2>
<p>I used to ask, “How do I let go?”<br>
The question haunted me. Mocked me.</p>
<p>I was a child of God living in bondage to addiction. I didn’t want to be an addict, so I asked the question honestly. But the truth was, I already knew the answer. I just didn’t like it.</p>
<p>Letting go, in God’s economy, isn’t symbolic.<br>
It means surrender—total surrender.<br>
Not giving up the fight, but giving up fighting.</p>
<p>“Thy will be done” sounds simple until you realize what it costs.</p>
<p>Because what I was really asking was this:<br>
Am I willing to die?</p>
<p>Not physically—but to have God surgically remove lust from me. Not just the behavior, but the thing I ran to when I was afraid, lonely, bored, ashamed, or empty. The thing that had medicated me for most of my life.</p>
<p>“I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” (Galatians 2:20)</p>
<p>I understood surrender clearly.<br>
What I didn’t know was whether I could survive without the thing that had been keeping me alive.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="knowledge-failed-me" tabindex="-1">Knowledge Failed Me</h2>
<p>In trying to escape addiction, I thought knowledge would do it for me. Theology. Insight. Self-awareness. I believed that if I could understand myself well enough, I could manage myself.</p>
<p>Instead, I experienced a prolonged beatdown.<br>
This disease beat the heck out of me.</p>
<p>Lust was wanting more—or something different—than what was being offered in the moment. And no amount of information changes that hunger.</p>
<p>Only a spiritual experience could keep me sober.<br>
“For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.” (1 Corinthians 4:20)</p>
<p>I didn’t want that to be true.<br>
But it was.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="powerlessness-wasnt-humiliating-it-was-accurate" tabindex="-1">Powerlessness Wasn’t Humiliating — It Was Accurate</h2>
<p>I had to remember that I am powerless.<br>
Not helpless.<br>
Not choiceless.<br>
But powerless over the thing that kept returning me to myself.</p>
<p>The source and center of all my problems was selfishness. Even my desire for recovery was selfish. I didn’t want transformation—I wanted relief. I just wanted to feel better.</p>
<p>Selfishness isn’t something I occasionally visit.<br>
It’s the water I’m swimming in.</p>
<p>As I moved through each day, I learned again that it’s not about me at all. It is about Him. But every morning, when I woke up, the switch was flipped back to me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh.”</em> <strong>—Romans 7:18</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s why I have to pray for willingness; it’s why I pray, “God, give me the courage and willingness to do whatever You need to do so that You can keep me sober today.”</p>
<p>Only God can remove my self-will.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="lust-was-the-medication-not-the-root" tabindex="-1">Lust Was the Medication, Not the Root</h2>
<p>For most of my life, lust was the medication that fixed everything.</p>
<p>Fear? Lust.<br>
Shame? Lust.<br>
Anger? Lust.<br>
Loneliness? Lust.</p>
<p>So the real question isn’t just <em>How do I stop?</em><br>
It’s <em>What pain is this lust trying to fix right now?</em></p>
<p>I used to believe that every bad thing that happened to me was because I masturbated. I believed my addiction was the root of all my other problems.</p>
<p>It wasn’t.</p>
<p>My problem was my sinful heart—and my desperate attempt to survive it on my own.</p>
<p>“The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?” (Jeremiah 17:9)</p>
<p>I didn’t fully realize I had a loving Higher Power.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="shame-couldnt-heal-me" tabindex="-1">Shame Couldn’t Heal Me</h2>
<p>I kept going back to God with shame. I believed shame was repentance. I believed suffering proved sincerity.</p>
<p>I never wanted my wife to find out—not because I feared she would leave, but because I believed I deserved for her to. I prayed she would never find out so she could be spared the pain. I knew how deeply it affected her, and I hated that I caused it.</p>
<p>Every relapse felt like betrayal—of God, of her, of myself. I had promised I would never do it again. And every time I did, something inside me hated me for it.</p>
<p>“Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation without regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.” (2 Corinthians 7:10)</p>
<p>Shame kept me coming back.<br>
But it never made me well.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="i-didnt-grow-up-safe-i-grew-up-alert" tabindex="-1">I Didn’t Grow Up Safe — I Grew Up Alert</h2>
<p>Growing up, I lived in fear. My father had rage. He beat my brother and me. He lashed out at my mother. My body learned vigilance long before it learned trust.</p>
<p>I promised myself I would never be like him. Every relapse felt like proof that I was failing that promise too.</p>
<p>Why couldn’t I be more like my brother?<br>
Because I wasn’t created to be like my brother.<br>
I was created to be like me.</p>
<p>“You knit me together in my mother’s womb… I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” (Psalm 139:13–14)</p>
<p>But I didn’t know how to be me without performing, provoking, or medicating.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="grace-did-what-knowledge-couldnt" tabindex="-1">Grace Did What Knowledge Couldn’t</h2>
<p>In 2018, I came to recovery too full of knowledge and too full of myself to succeed. I thought it was safe to drive with my addiction. I never saw the warning label: Don’t operate heavy equipment.</p>
<p>I walked around thinking I knew what I was doing. In reality, my brain was mush.</p>
<p>I feel like my kids, my wife, and my friends all knew it—but I didn’t.</p>
<p>“When I wanted to do good, evil lay close at hand.” (Romans 7:21)</p>
<p>My addiction made me the person I used to be.<br>
My recovery has made me the person I am today.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-question-finally-changed" tabindex="-1">The Question Finally Changed</h2>
<p>I used to ask, <em>Why me? Why do I have this problem?</em><br>
Now I ask, <em>Why me? Why am I finding recovery?</em></p>
<p>That shift didn’t come from insight.<br>
It came from being broken enough to stop negotiating.</p>
<p>I am powerless—but I am not abandoned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness.”</em> <strong>—2 Corinthians 12:9</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-closing-word" tabindex="-1">A Closing Word</h2>
<p>I am still learning what surrender looks like one day at a time. I still wake up self-centered. I still need help I cannot provide for myself.</p>
<p>This is not the story of my willpower.<br>
It is the story of a God who met me where my will finally ran out.</p>
<p>If there is any hope here, it is not that I figured it out—but that I stopped pretending I could.</p>
<p>And that, so far, has been enough.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Father,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am still in process.<br>
Still learning.<br>
Still waking up thinking it’s about me.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Teach me again today what surrender actually means.<br>
Give me willingness when I don’t feel it.<br>
Give me honesty when I want to hide.<br>
Give me courage to stay in the light.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If Your grace truly is sufficient, let it be sufficient for me—today.<br>
Not because I deserve it.<br>
Not because I understand it.<br>
But because I need it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

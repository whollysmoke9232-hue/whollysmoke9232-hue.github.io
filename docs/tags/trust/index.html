In the margins of our striving, His grace whispers strength. This devotional invites you to lay down self-effort and discover the power of being still before God.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Psalm 23 is not a wish or a sentiment, but a declaration of settled reality. In valley and pasture alike, the Shepherd’s presence—not the absence of danger—is the source of comfort and confidence.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">A prayer of mercy, refuge, and trust when deliverance does not guarantee escape.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Relationship comes before understanding. God leads us into truth before He teaches us.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Prayer does not begin with effort or obligation, but with relationship. We seek God not to earn His favor, but because He has already drawn near to us.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Fear multiplies in imagined futures, but faith finds its footing in a single, steady truth: God is for me.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">What does it really mean to seek first the Kingdom of God? A reflection on priority, focus, righteousness by faith, and the quiet promise that the Father will provide what we truly need.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">David asks not merely for protection, but to live close enough to God that danger must meet Him first.</p>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">A contrast between well-worn sayings heard in church culture and enduring truth, this reflection calls for a faith that lives beyond Sunday—one that stands in weakness, walks through darkness, and overcomes through Christ.</p>
            
          </li>

              <p style="margin: 0.5rem 0 0 0; color: #666; font-size: 0.9rem;">Forgiveness is freely given in Christ, yet many of us continue to live under guilt. Psalm 51 reminds us that confession is not groveling before an angry God, but returning to a gracious Father who has always been ready to restore.</p>

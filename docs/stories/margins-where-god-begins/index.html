<h1 id="foreword" tabindex="-1">Foreword</h1>
<p>There are books that explain Scripture, and there are books that invite you to enter it.<br>
This is the latter.</p>
<p>Most of us have been trained to read the Bible for answers—what to do, what to believe, how to live. And while Scripture certainly speaks to all of that, <em>Margins: Where God Begins</em> gently invites us to something deeper: to slow down, to look again, and to wonder.</p>
<p>Steve Wilkins asks an unusual question—not what the Bible says, but where God is before it says anything at all.</p>
<p>In a world obsessed with speed, clarity, and outcomes, this book draws our attention to the spaces we usually overlook: the pauses, the silence, the waiting, the margins. Those places where we assume nothing is happening. Those places we rush past on our way to something more important.</p>
<p>And then, quietly but firmly, Steve reminds us that God has always done His best work there.</p>
<p>What makes this book compelling is not merely its theological insight—though it is rich with Scripture and grounded in the grand narrative of redemption—but its honesty. These pages are not written from abstraction, but from lived experience. From seasons of loss and stillness. From long hours in the Word. From a soul that has learned, sometimes painfully, that God is not reacting to our lives—He is revealing Himself through them.</p>
<p>As you read, you will notice something: this book does not strain to persuade. It does not shout. It does not rush you toward conclusions. It trusts the reader. More importantly, it trusts God.</p>
<p>The central idea—that before the first word of Genesis was written, God already knew the entire story—is not new theology. But here, it is explored with fresh eyes and a tender heart. Steve leads us to see that the God who knew the end from the beginning also knows us—fully, intimately, eternally. That our lives are not a series of interruptions to His plan, but threads intentionally woven into it.</p>
<p>Again and again, you will be invited to consider a liberating truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if the places you’ve labeled as delays are actually divine appointments?</li>
<li>What if the silence you fear is sacred?</li>
<li>What if the margin is not where God is absent—but where He is most present?</li>
</ul>
<p>This book does not promise easy answers. It offers something better: perspective. Peace. Rest. A renewed trust in the God who sees the whole tapestry when all we can see are loose threads.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, <em>Margins: Where God Begins</em> gently reorients how we see ourselves. We are not projects God is still fixing. We are not mysteries He is trying to solve. We are not stories waiting to be finished.</p>
<p>In Christ, it <strong>is finished</strong>.</p>
<p>What remains is our awakening to that reality.</p>
<p>As you read, I encourage you not to rush. Let the words linger. Sit with the questions. Pay attention to what stirs in you. This book is not meant to be conquered—it is meant to be inhabited.</p>
<p>And when you reach the end, you may find that you haven’t arrived somewhere new at all. You may simply realize what has been true all along:</p>
<p>You were already in the margin.<br>
And God was already there.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="introduction" tabindex="-1">Introduction</h1>
<p>What’s your favorite place in the Bible?</p>
<p>Is it a verse? A passage? A chapter? Maybe a book? For some, it’s John 3:16. For others, the nativity. Still others are drawn to the resurrection, the Psalms, the prophets, or the letters of Paul.</p>
<p>I love them all.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many verses that I find challenging and encouraging; and different sections and books that I return to often. I could make a case for each one being my favorite.</p>
<p>But none of them are.</p>
<p>My favorite place in the Bible isn’t a verse at all. It’s a space. A margin. That tiny sliver of white just to the left of Genesis 1:1.</p>
<p>That’s where this journey began.</p>
<p>During a season of stillness, I found myself reading the Bible like never before—cover to cover, again and again. Fourteen times in twenty-two months. And in that saturation, I began to see things I’d never seen before: the thread, the design, the divine choreography.</p>
<p>I saw how every story, every life, every moment was part of something much bigger.</p>
<p>I saw that God was never reacting—He was revealing. That He wasn’t figuring things out—He already knew. That before the first word was spoken, the entire story was already written within the mind of God.</p>
<p>This book is an invitation to step into that margin. To pause. To wonder. To see your life not as a series of disconnected events, but as a thread in the eternal tapestry of God’s plan.</p>
<p>You are not outside of His reach.<br>
You are not outside of His love.<br>
You are already in the margin.</p>
<p>Where God’s plan begins.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="part-1-the-eternal-margin" tabindex="-1">Part 1: The Eternal Margin</h1>
<p>Before time began, God already knew.</p>
<p>Before creation unfolded, the story was complete in His mind.</p>
<p>This section explores the eternal nature of God’s knowledge, presence, and purpose—the margin before the beginning where nothing was uncertain and nothing was accidental.</p>
<p>Here, we learn to trust the God who sees the whole tapestry when we can only see a single thread.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-1-the-margin-before-genesis" tabindex="-1">Chapter 1: The Margin Before Genesis</h2>
<p>Before the first word was spoken, before the first light pierced the darkness, before time itself began—there was a margin.</p>
<p>Not a void.<br>
Not a blank.<br>
But a space filled with the fullness of God.</p>
<p>It’s the space just to the left of Genesis 1:1 in your Bible. Go ahead—open it. Look at it. That tiny sliver of white space before the words <em>“In the beginning…”</em> That’s where my favorite part of the Bible lives. Not in a verse or a chapter, not even in a book—but in that sacred silence before the story begins.</p>
<p>Because in that margin, God already knows.</p>
<p>He knows the entire story—every thought, every intention, every word, every life, every rise and fall, every act of redemption. He knew the laughter of Sarah and the tears of Jeremiah. He knew the betrayal of Judas and the restoration of Peter. He knew the cross. He knew the empty tomb. He knew you. He knew me.</p>
<p>And He had a plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-season-of-saturation" tabindex="-1">A Season of Saturation</h2>
<p>For most of 2023 and 2024, I found myself in a season of stillness. I had more time on my hands than I’d ever had before. What began as boredom turned into a divine appointment.</p>
<p>I started reading—10 to 14 hours a day. Dozens of Christian books filled my shelves and my soul. Some of these books captivated my spirit, leading me to read them several times. In fact, there were a couple that I read so many times that I began to wonder if I could rewrite them myself.</p>
<p>But one book drew me in like no other: the Bible.</p>
<p>I read it cover to cover. Not once, but fourteen times in twenty-two months. Genesis to Revelation, again and again. I read it silently. I read it aloud. I read it to a friend who was legally blind and had never owned a Bible. We read together for hours each day, and somewhere between Genesis and Ruth, he met Jesus.</p>
<p>What a privilege that the Father allowed me to play a small part in that.</p>
<p>That season changed me. God used His Word to teach me, stretch me, correct me, and comfort me. But more than anything, He used it to reveal Himself. And the more I read, the more I saw how it all fits together—how the threads of history, prophecy, poetry, and promise are woven into one seamless story.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-story-before-the-story" tabindex="-1">The Story Before the Story</h2>
<p>The deeper I went, the more I realized something profound: none of this was accidental. Every moment in Scripture is the result of countless moments before it. Every encounter is the culmination of a thousand unseen choices, circumstances, and divine nudges.</p>
<p>For the first time, I realized that the history books are just that—history. They are the story of lives that were actually lived.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-story-of-joseph-genesis-3750" tabindex="-1">The Story of Joseph (Genesis 37–50)</h3>
<p>Think about Joseph, the son of Jacob.</p>
<ul>
<li>He was favored by his father.</li>
<li>Despised by his brothers.</li>
<li>Sold into slavery.</li>
<li>Favored by his master.</li>
<li>Unjustly thrown into prison.</li>
<li>Favored by his jailer.</li>
<li>Forgotten by the cupbearer.</li>
</ul>
<p>From his vantage point, things looked grim—maybe even hopeless. Nothing made sense. Every step forward seemed to be followed by two steps back.</p>
<p>But God was doing something.</p>
<p>Every moment of Joseph’s life—every betrayal, every injustice, every delay—was preparation. God was shaping him, humbling him, positioning him. All of it was leading to a moment Joseph couldn’t yet see.</p>
<p>So he could save his family from famine.<br>
So he could bring them to Egypt.<br>
So they could become a nation.<br>
So the promise to Abraham could be fulfilled.<br>
So the Messiah could come.</p>
<p>Joseph didn’t see the big picture.<br>
But God did.</p>
<p>Joseph lived in the margins.<br>
But God was writing the masterpiece.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-margin-of-eternity" tabindex="-1">The Margin of Eternity</h2>
<p>That’s why I keep coming back to the margin before Genesis 1:1. Because in that space, God already knows. He saw the whole story before the first word was written. He still sees it all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Your eyes saw my unformed body; all the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be.”</em><br>
—Psalm 139:16 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“He chose us in Him before the creation of the world.”</em><br>
—Ephesians 1:4</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.”</em><br>
—Revelation 13:8</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the beginning, He was already there.<br>
Already loving.<br>
Already planning.<br>
Already redeeming.</p>
<p>That margin is not empty.<br>
It’s full of purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>Have you ever paused to consider what God knew before your beginning?</p>
<p>What if your life—your story—is not a series of random events, but a carefully woven thread in a divine tapestry?</p>
<p>The margin before Genesis reminds us that we are not accidents. We are not forgotten. We are part of a story that began before time and will echo into eternity.</p>
<p>And the Author?<br>
He’s still writing.<br>
Still revealing.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><strong>Lord</strong>, thank You for knowing me before I ever knew You. Thank You for the margin—the space where Your eternal plan began. Help me trust that You are weaving my life into something beautiful, even when I can’t see the pattern. Teach me to rest in the knowledge that You knew… and You still chose me.<br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-gods-plan" tabindex="-1">Interlude: God’s Plan</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>Throughout my life, I’ve been on a road. Along this road, there have been countless events and encounters—each one shaping me, preparing me for something still ahead.</p>
<p>Cause and effect.</p>
<p>The beauty of cause and effect is that every effect becomes a new cause, setting something else in motion.</p>
<p>God has a plan for me. A path I’m meant to follow. But here’s the challenge: I don’t know what’s coming. I can’t see the next bend in the road, let alone prepare for it. That’s why my path is rarely a straight line.</p>
<p>Every detour is necessary.</p>
<p>Some are gentle curves. Others are sharp turns—painful, even jarring. But I’m learning that these detours are not delays. They are divine preparations.</p>
<p>God knows what lies ahead, and He knows what I’ll need when I get there. The lessons I learn in the detour are the tools I’ll need for the next destination.</p>
<p>And then, that destination becomes the next preparation.</p>
<p>So I’m learning to stop fighting.<br>
To stop trying to escape the hard places.<br>
I’m learning to be present.<br>
To live in the moment.<br>
And to leave what’s next in God’s hands.</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-2-the-god-who-knows" tabindex="-1">Chapter 2: The God Who Knows</h2>
<p>Before the first word of creation was spoken, God already knew – or better, God already knows.</p>
<p>He knew the shape of the universe, the rhythm of time, the rise and fall of nations. He knew the names of every star and the number of hairs on every head. He knew the sound of your voice before you ever cried your first breath. He knew the choices you would make, the prayers you would whisper, the tears you would shed. He knew all the times you would excel, and all the times you would fail.</p>
<p>He knew.<br>
And He still chose to create.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-comfort-of-being-known" tabindex="-1">The Comfort of Being Known</h2>
<p>There’s a deep comfort in being known. Not just seen, not just tolerated—but truly, intimately known. We spend so much of our lives trying to be understood, trying to explain ourselves, trying to make sense of our own hearts. But God already knows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“O Lord, you have searched me and known me.<br>
You know when I sit down and when I rise up;<br>
you discern my thoughts from afar.”<br>
—Psalm 139:1–2 (ESV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God doesn’t need to investigate you. He doesn’t need to wait and see how your story unfolds. He already knows every detail of your life from beginning to end—and He loves you anyway. And it’s not because He can see into or predict the future. It’s because He’s there, right now, witnessing your future. Your entire future. Watching it unfold. Even while He is beside you in this moment.</p>
<p>That’s not just comforting. That’s transformational.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-plan-was-never-plan-b" tabindex="-1">The Plan Was Never Plan B</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful revelations I’ve come to embrace is this: God has never had a Plan B.</p>
<p>The cross wasn’t a reaction. Redemption wasn’t a backup plan. Jesus wasn’t sent because humanity surprised God with its brokenness. He was “the Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world” (Revelation 13:8). Before Adam ever fell, Christ had already risen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world.”<br>
—Ephesians 1:4 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means your life isn’t a series of divine improvisations. It’s a masterpiece unfolding in time, already complete in the mind of God.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-god-who-sees-all-time-at-once" tabindex="-1">The God Who Sees All Time at Once</h2>
<p>We live in a linear world. Past, present, future. One moment after another. But God exists beyond time. He sees the whole timeline at once—like an artist viewing the entire canvas, not just the brushstroke in progress.</p>
<p>That means He sees you not only as you are, but as you will be. He sees the healed version of you. The whole version. The glorified version. And He relates to you from that place.</p>
<p>So when He calls you righteous, even when you feel broken—He’s not lying. He’s speaking from the end of the story.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-weight-of-glory" tabindex="-1">The Weight of Glory</h2>
<p>There’s a holy weight to being known by God. It’s not just that He knows your name—it’s that He knows your purpose. He knows what He placed inside you. He knows what He’s building through you. And He knows how every trial, every delay, every detour is shaping you into the image of His Son.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For those God foreknew He also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of His Son.”<br>
—Romans 8:29 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not a mystery to God. You are not a disappointment. You are not behind schedule.</p>
<p>You are known. And you are right on time. You are right where you are supposed to be.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-1" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What would change if you truly believed that God already knows?</p>
<p>Would you worry less? Would you trust more? Would you stop striving to earn what He’s already given?</p>
<p>The God who knows you is not waiting to see how your story ends. He’s already written it. And He’s walking with you through every page.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer-1" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Father, thank You for knowing me completely. For seeing every part of me—past, present, and future—and loving me still. Help me rest in the truth that I am not hidden from You. That nothing surprises You. That You are not reacting to my life but revealing Your plan through it. Teach me to trust the God who knows. Amen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-not-a-remodel" tabindex="-1">Interlude: Not a Remodel</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>Soon after I invited Jesus into my life, I expected Him to come in and remodel my house.</p>
<p>It made sense. After all, He built me in the first place—He knew where all the plumbing, electrical, mechanical, and structural strengths and weaknesses were. Who better to do the renovations?</p>
<p>But I soon learned He wasn’t interested in a simple remodel.</p>
<p>He began tearing out walls.<br>
Adding rooms.<br>
Building wings.<br>
Raising new levels.</p>
<p>And then it hit me:</p>
<p>The house He was building wasn’t for me at all.</p>
<p>He was building me into something far greater—<br>
A beautiful, spacious mansion…<br>
Fit for a King.</p>
<p>He is transforming me into “… a temple of the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>—1 Corinthians 6:19 (NIV)</p>
</div>
<hr>
<h2 id="chapter-3-the-tapestry-of-time" tabindex="-1">Chapter 3: The Tapestry of Time</h2>
<p>God doesn’t just know the story—He weaves it.</p>
<p>Every thread. Every color. Every knot. Every frayed edge. He weaves it all into something beautiful, something eternal, something far more intricate than we can see from where we stand.</p>
<p>We live on the underside of the tapestry. From here, it often looks like chaos—loose ends, tangled threads, patterns that don’t make sense. But from above, from the vantage point of eternity, God sees the full design. And He’s never once lost the thread.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="nothing-happens-in-a-vacuum" tabindex="-1">Nothing Happens in a Vacuum</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful realizations I’ve had in my time immersed in Scripture is this: no one in the Bible lived in isolation. No story stands alone. Every person, every event, every encounter is connected to something before it—and something after it.</p>
<p>Take Levi, the tax collector. Luke tells us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector by the name of Levi sitting at his tax booth. ‘Follow me,’ Jesus said to him, and Levi got up, left everything and followed him.”<br>
—Luke 5:27–28 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to read that as a moment in isolation. But Levi had a past. He had parents, teachers, wounds, regrets. He had known joy and sorrow, victory and defeat. He had lived a life that led him to that exact place, on that exact day, in that exact frame of mind—when Jesus walked by and said, “Follow Me.”</p>
<p>And Levi followed.</p>
<p>That moment wasn’t random. It was the result of a thousand unseen threads. And it became a thread that would weave into the lives of others—into the gospel story itself.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-sycamore-tree" tabindex="-1">The Sycamore Tree</h2>
<p>Think about Zacchaeus. A short man. A curious heart. A tree.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him, since Jesus was coming that way.”<br>
—Luke 19:4 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that tree didn’t just happen to be there. It had to be planted. It had to grow. It had to be protected from storms and drought and disease. It had to be protected from grazing livestock and marching armies. Long before Zacchaeus ever climbed it, God was preparing it.</p>
<p>That’s how God works. He plants trees decades before we need them. He sets different lives on specific paths so that they will intersect at the perfect time. He sets things in motion long before we realize we’re part of the plan.</p>
<p>Zacchaeus had a divine appointment with Jesus. And he needed a Sycamore tree to keep it. So God appointed a tree.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-thread-of-your-life" tabindex="-1">The Thread of Your Life</h2>
<p>Your life is not a series of disconnected moments. It’s a thread in a divine tapestry. And every joy, every sorrow, every delay, every detour—it’s all being woven into something greater than you can imagine.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose.”<br>
—Romans 8:28
That verse doesn’t mean everything is good. It means everything is used. Nothing is wasted. Not the pain. Not the waiting. Not the questions. God is weaving it all.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="when-the-pattern-doesnt-make-sense" tabindex="-1">When the Pattern Doesn’t Make Sense</h2>
<p>There are seasons when the thread of your life seems to disappear—when you can’t see how anything fits. But that’s not the end of the story. That’s just the underside of the tapestry.</p>
<p>God is still weaving.</p>
<p>He knows us. He knows that if we could see what He was preparing us for, we would find less painful shortcuts to get there. Which would result in our arriving there unprepared. He loves us too much for that.</p>
<p>One day, whether in this life or the next, you’ll see the full design. You’ll see how every thread mattered. How every moment was connected. How every “why” had a purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-2" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What if you believed that nothing in your life was wasted?</p>
<p>What if you trusted that even the tangled threads are part of the design?</p>
<p>You are not lost in the chaos. You are woven into the plan.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer-2" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Master Weaver, thank You for holding the thread of my life. Thank You for weaving beauty from brokenness, purpose from pain, and glory from the ordinary. Help me trust You when I can’t see the pattern. Remind me that I am not forgotten—I am woven. Amen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-its-about-you" tabindex="-1">Interlude: It’s About You</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>O God, this isn’t about me at all;<br>
it is about You.<br>
It has always been about You.<br>
You alone.</p>
<p>How could I think that any of this was for me?</p>
<p>All of this is to bring You glory.</p>
<p>I can’t see the end.<br>
I don’t know how, but You will be lifted up.<br>
Men will turn to You.<br>
They will know that You alone are God.</p>
<p>It is You who rescues.<br>
You who redeems.<br>
You who lifts my soul from the grave.</p>
<p>My life is in Your hands.<br>
There is nowhere I would rather be.</p>

<p>If the eternal margin reveals who God is before time began,<br>
the unfolding margin reveals how He moves within time.</p>
<p>This section explores how God speaks, pauses, and unfolds His purposes—not all at once, but moment by moment, invitation by invitation.</p>
<p>Here, we learn that the margin is not static.<br>
It is alive.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-4-the-word-before-the-word" tabindex="-1">Chapter 4: The Word Before the Word</h2>
<p>Before there was light, there was the Word.<br>
Before there was time, there was the Word.<br>
Before there was a beginning, there was the Word.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.<br>
He was with God in the beginning. Through Him all things were made;<br>
without Him nothing was made that has been made.”<br>
—John 1:1–3 (NIV)</p>

<p>John doesn’t start his gospel with a manger. He starts with eternity. He takes us back—not just to Genesis 1:1, but to the margin before it. And there, in that eternal space, we find Jesus.</p>

<h2 id="christ-before-creation" tabindex="-1">Christ Before Creation</h2>
<p>Jesus didn’t begin in Bethlehem. He didn’t begin in Mary’s womb. He didn’t begin at all. He always was.</p>
<p>He is the Word before the Word.</p>
<p>The One who spoke creation into existence. The One who walked with Adam, wrestled with Jacob, and appeared in the fire with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The pre-incarnate Christ was always present—always active—always central to the story.</p>
<p>And then, He stepped into the story He authored.</p>

<h2 id="the-word-became-flesh" tabindex="-1">The Word Became Flesh</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Word became flesh and made His dwelling among us.”<br>
—John 1:14 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The eternal became temporal. The infinite became touchable. The Author became a character in His own story—not to observe, but to redeem.</p>
<p>This is the mystery of the incarnation: that the One who existed before time entered time. That the One who created the world allowed Himself to be born into it. That the Word who spoke stars into being would one day cry out in anguish on a cross.</p>
<p>And He did it for love.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-voice-that-still-speaks" tabindex="-1">The Voice That Still Speaks</h2>
<p>The Word didn’t stop speaking after creation. He still speaks.</p>
<p>He speaks through Scripture. Through the Spirit. Through family, friends, and others. Through the quiet moments when your heart is still enough to hear Him. He speaks in the margins of your life—the spaces between the noise, the pauses between the plans.</p>
<p>And when He speaks, things change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword…”<br>
—Hebrews 4:12 (NIV)</p>

<p>The same Word that created the universe is now at work in you. Not as a distant echo, but as a living presence.</p>

<p>If Christ is the Word, and the Word lives in you, then you carry eternity within you. You carry the voice that calmed storms, cast out demons, and called Lazarus from the grave. You carry the very power of creation.</p>

<h2 id="interlude-a-holy-moment" tabindex="-1">Interlude: A Holy Moment</h2>
<div style="font-style: italic;">
<p>“The heavens declare the glory of God... They have no speech, they use no words; their voice is not heard.”<br>
—Psalm 19:1–3</p>
<p>This morning, as I read Psalm 19, a passage that speaks of creation's silent, ceaseless worship, I found my gaze drifting out my window. Beyond the fence line, a cluster of trees stood, their branches reaching skyward. A gentle breeze began to stir, and in an instant, a thousand limbs, laden with hundreds of thousands of leaves, began to sway back and forth in a mesmerizing rhythm.</p>
<p>I paused, contemplating God's incredible handiwork. How remarkable, I thought, that He designed these limbs to be strong enough to withstand the fury of a storm, yet flexible enough to dance with the slightest breeze. Were they too rigid, they would simply snap and fall. This balance of strength and grace is a testament to His wisdom.</p>
<p>But then, the scene shifted. The limbs continued their rhythmic movement, yet suddenly, I saw them differently. It was as though they were waving directly at me. Thousands of limbs, in this symphony of movement—or was it a dance?—all seemed to be acknowledging my presence. As if to say, “We know you're still there. We are still out here. We just wanted to say, ‘Good morning!’”</p>
<p>In that moment, I was utterly overcome. Tears of gratitude welled up and spilled over. Our God, the Creator of such intricate beauty and strength, is truly a good, good Father. And I, in that quiet instance, felt profoundly loved by Him.</p>
<p>So I stood there for several minutes, tears streaming down my face, simply waving back to the trees. It was a holy moment, a silent conversation between a beloved child and the Father, witnessed and orchestrated by the very creation He made. The trees spoke without words, and my heart heard a message loud and clear:</p>
<p>You are seen.<br>
You are loved.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-5-the-power-of-the-pause" tabindex="-1">Chapter 5: The Power of the Pause</h2>
<p>We tend to measure life by movement.<br>
Progress. Productivity. Momentum.</p>
<p>But God often moves most powerfully in the pause.</p>
<p>The Bible is filled with them—moments of silence, waiting, stillness. Moments when nothing seems to be happening on the surface, but everything is shifting beneath it. These pauses are not empty. They are pregnant with purpose.</p>
<p>They are margins.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-silence-between-testaments" tabindex="-1">The Silence Between Testaments</h2>
<p>There are 400 years between the final words of Malachi and the opening lines of Matthew. Four centuries of prophetic silence. No new revelations. No angelic visitations. Just silence.</p>
<p>But God wasn’t absent. He was preparing.</p>
<p>In that pause, empires rose and fell. Roads were built. Languages spread. The world was being aligned for the arrival of the Messiah. The silence wasn’t a void—it was a setup.</p>
<p>God was orchestrating the perfect conditions for the Word to become flesh.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-pause-before-the-resurrection" tabindex="-1">The Pause Before the Resurrection</h2>
<p>There’s a reason we call it “Good Friday” and “Resurrection Sunday.” But what about Saturday?</p>
<p>That in-between day. That silent, uncertain, grief-soaked pause.</p>
<p>The disciples didn’t know Sunday was coming. All they had was silence. Confusion. Fear. Waiting.</p>
<p>But even in the tomb, God was working. Even in the pause, the plan was unfolding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-margins-of-our-lives" tabindex="-1">The Margins of Our Lives</h2>
<p>We all have seasons that feel like pauses.</p>
<ul>
<li>The job that hasn’t come.</li>
<li>The healing that hasn’t happened.</li>
<li>The prayer that hasn’t been answered.</li>
<li>The dream that hasn’t been fulfilled.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s easy to believe that God is only present in the action—in the breakthroughs, the miracles, the movement. But He is just as present in the waiting. In fact, it’s in those times of waiting that God is closest to us. Healing us. Preparing us. Restoring us. Carrying us.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the pause is the point.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-god-builds-in-the-stillness" tabindex="-1">What God Builds in the Stillness</h2>
<p>In the pause, God builds trust.<br>
In the pause, He deepens roots.<br>
In the pause, He prepares us for what’s next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Be still, and know that I am God.”<br>
—Psalm 46:10 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stillness is not passivity. It’s surrender. It’s choosing to believe that God is working even when we can’t see it. That He is weaving even when the thread disappears from view.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-sacred-rhythm" tabindex="-1">The Sacred Rhythm</h2>
<p>Creation itself was born in rhythm:</p>
<p>God spoke. Then He paused.<br>
He created. Then He rested.</p>
<p>The pause is part of the pattern. It’s not a disruption—it’s divine design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens…”<br>
—Ecclesiastes 3:1 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even Jesus paused. He withdrew to lonely places. He waited for the right hour. He moved in step with the Father’s timing.</p>
<p>If the Son of God embraced the pause, so can we.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-4" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>Where in your life are you experiencing a pause?</p>
<p>What if it’s not a delay, but a design?</p>
<p>What if the silence is sacred?</p>
<p>God is not absent in the stillness. He is present. He is preparing. He is speaking—sometimes most clearly—through the quiet.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer-4" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Father, thank You for the pauses. For the stillness. For the silence that speaks. Teach me to trust You when nothing seems to be moving. Help me to rest in the knowledge that You are always working, always weaving, always present. Even in the pause. Especially in the pause. Amen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-mustard-seed-faith" tabindex="-1">Interlude: Mustard Seed Faith</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>We often talk about miracles as things we witness. But in God’s margins, they’re not only seen—they’re shared. Participation is the miracle. Just ask the disciples on a hillside with five loaves, two fish, and twenty thousand people.</p>
<p>They didn’t just observe the miraculous. Jesus made them a part of it.</p>
<p>This moment is a pivot point in their journey—not just in logistics but in trust. He hands them broken bread, and as they move, the bread regenerates. And then the miracle spreads—from Jesus to disciple, to recipient, to household. The bread continued to regenerate until everyone had enough – even more than enough -- with twelve baskets left to prove God doesn’t do barely enough. He does overflow.</p>
<p>But what happens when the wind picks up?</p>
<p>That’s the tension between faith and fear—between mountain-moving confidence and trembling obedience. Peter understood both. One moment, he’s walking on water; the next, he’s sinking in it. But when Peter’s faith faltered, Jesus caught him. Not to shame him. To remind him. Peter’s “little” faith was enough to empower him to walk on water.</p>
<p>Mustard seed faith isn’t static. It stretches. It walks. It wobbles. And yes—it multiplies.</p>
<p>God invites us into moments where doubt meets action—and action births awe.</p>
<p>You have enough faith. Even if it’s only enough faith to pray for more faith.</p>
<p>God will always reward that prayer.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-6-the-big-picture" tabindex="-1">Chapter 6: The Big Picture</h2>
<h2 id="what-job-didnt-know" tabindex="-1">What Job Didn’t Know</h2>
<p>I started reading Job one day.</p>
<p>This was not the first time I'd read Job; though I'll confess that I’ve never much enjoyed the read. I had always found the long speeches confusing and hard to follow. However, something struck me this time that I'd never thought of before while reading Job.</p>
<p>It turns out that neither Job nor his friends knew what was happening while it was happening.</p>
<p>The first two chapters give us insight that the “stars” of the story didn't have. We see that while Job was losing <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>, God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than Job or his friends (or his wife) could see. In fact, Job never did learn about the events that took place in the first two chapters.</p>
<p>While it seemed to Job and his friends that his ordeal was due to some sin or omission, the truth was God was allowing Satan’s attack on Job <strong>because of his righteousness before God</strong>!</p>
<p>As I pondered this reality throughout the morning, a bigger picture began to emerge.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="when-the-brushstrokes-dont-make-sense" tabindex="-1">When the Brushstrokes Don’t Make Sense</h2>
<p>When God slaughtered an innocent animal in the Garden to make clothes for Adam and Eve (Genesis 3:21), He was painting on a canvas that was bigger than what they could see.</p>
<p>When God told Abraham to offer Isaac as a sacrifice (Genesis 22:2), He was painting on a canvas that was bigger than either of them could see.</p>
<p>When Moses fled to Midian (Exodus 2:15), God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than Moses could see.</p>
<p>When Sampson told Delilah the secret to his strength (Judges 16:17), God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than either of them could see.</p>
<p>When Joseph's brothers sold him into slavery (Genesis 37:28); when David should have been “off to war” (2 Samuel 11:1); “In the year that King Uzziah died” (Isaiah 6:1); when Mary was engaged to be married to Joseph (Matthew 1:18); when Judas betrayed Jesus (Luke 22:4); God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than any of them could see.</p>
<p>When I was fired from two different churches, God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than what I could see.</p>
<p>While I stood on our National Lawn with nearly 1,000,000 other Promise Keepers—committing to be more faithful in my walk, my family, and my ministry—God was painting on a canvas that was bigger than what I could see.</p>
<hr>
<p>There have been times when God has lifted the veil to allow a glimpse of a portion of His painting. When Isaiah got a glimpse, he fell down as a dead man. When John got a glimpse, he fell down as a dead man. Many prophets were murdered when they spoke of what they saw.</p>
<p>Apparently, the Big Picture is far bigger than anything we can see—at least if we hope to survive!</p>
<p>From time to time, God allows us a glimpse of the unfinished picture that is our lives—past, present, or future—when it suits His purposes to do so. But these glimpses are few and far between. And we will never see the full picture—this side of heaven, at least.</p>
<p>God has a plan. A perfect plan. And we—you and I—are part of that plan. We may never fully understand that plan before we die.</p>
<p>He moves us from one place to another—leading us, teaching us, breaking us, building us up… all the while loving us with an unconditional love. Working His perfect plan.</p>
<p>So we are left to live out our faith with nothing more than faith in His Word, and the assurance that whatever we are experiencing—whether laughter or tears; joy or pain; wealth or want; success or failure—God is painting on a canvas that is bigger than we can see.</p>
<p>He is in control. And He is never surprised by what happens in our lives.</p>
<p>I pray that this truth will soak into your soul and usher into your spirit the peace that surpasses understanding.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-trusting-the-unseen" tabindex="-1">Reflection: Trusting the Unseen</h2>
<p>Take a moment to consider the scenes in your life that felt confusing, painful, or even pointless. What if those moments weren’t detours, but brushstrokes? What if the silence wasn’t absence, but preparation?</p>
<p>We often long for clarity, but God offers something better: Himself. He doesn’t always show us the full picture, but He promises that we are part of it—and that it is good.</p>
<p>Ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where in my life have I mistaken a margin for a mistake?</li>
<li>What moments might God be using as preparation for something I cannot yet see?</li>
<li>Am I willing to trust the Artist, even when I don’t understand the art?</li>
</ul>
<p>Let this truth settle in: You are not forgotten. You are not off-course. You are not outside the frame. You are part of the masterpiece.</p>

<p>You are the Master Artist, painting with eternity in mind.<br>

Even when I don’t understand, You are working.<br>
Even when I feel lost, You are leading.</p>
<p>Forgive me for the times I’ve doubted Your hand in the margins.<br>
Forgive me for demanding to see the whole picture before I trust You.</p>
<p>Teach me to rest in the mystery.<br>
To believe that every brushstroke—every joy, every sorrow—is part of Your perfect plan.</p>
<p>Give me eyes of faith to see beyond the moment.<br>
Give me a heart that trusts when the canvas is still blank.<br>
And give me peace that surpasses understanding,</p>
<p>knowing that You are always painting on a canvas bigger than I can see.</p>
<p>In Jesus’ name,<br>
Amen.</p>

<h2 id="interlude-righteousness-a-gift-from-first-to-last" tabindex="-1">Interlude: Righteousness: A Gift from First to Last</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>“For in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed —a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: ‘The righteous will live by faith.’”<br>
—Romans 1:17</p>
<p>Have you ever felt the weight of trying to be “good enough”? The relentless striving, the constant measuring, the nagging feeling that you always fall short? The good news of the Gospel cuts through all of that striving with a profound truth: the righteousness of God is not something we earn; it's something He reveals and credits to our account.</p>
<p>As Romans 1:17 beautifully puts it, this is “a righteousness that is by faith from first to last.” There is absolutely nothing we can do, no good deed, no amount of effort, to earn this perfect righteousness. It is freely given to us, credited to us by faith, just as it was to Abraham (Genesis 15:6).</p>
<p>At the moment of our salvation, what do we bring to the table? Only our faith. We surrender our attempts to earn, and we simply trust in His finished work.</p>
<p>But faith isn't just the entry point; it's the entire journey. Faith is also the goal of our life after salvation.</p>
<p>As we walk with Christ, our lives are gradually transformed into His image. This transformation isn't fueled by our own striving, but by an ongoing, active faith. It's as we apply what He reveals to us through our study of His Word, through prayer, and through the guidance of the Holy Spirit, that our character begins to reflect His.</p>
<p>And here's another humbling, yet liberating, truth: even faith itself is a gift from the Holy Spirit. It's not something we conjure up on our own, but a divine enablement that allows us to receive all that God has for us.</p>
<p>So, let go of the burden of earning. Embrace the freedom of receiving. From the moment we first believe to the very end of our journey, it is all by faith – a gift that empowers us to live a righteous life, not for salvation, but from salvation.</p>

<p>You might think this would get old. I’ve been doing it—off and on—for over forty years. It’s still fresh. And God still speaks.</p>
<h2 id="after-you-read" tabindex="-1">After You Read</h2>
<ul>
<li>Ask God to establish His Word in your spirit.</li>
<li>Ask Him to shape you according to His will.</li>
<li>If you feel a hunger for more, follow it. Expand your reading. There’s no wrong place to start in Scripture.</li>
</ul>
<p>God promises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“So will My word be which goes forth from My mouth;<br>
It will not return to Me empty,<br>
Without accomplishing what I desire,<br>
And without succeeding in the matter for which I sent it.”</em><br>
—Isaiah 55:11 (NASB)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So read. Let His Word pour into your heart.</p>
<p>Then celebrate His work in and through you.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-8-living-in-the-margin" tabindex="-1">Chapter 8: Living in the Margin</h2>
<p>If the margin before Genesis 1:1 is where God’s plan begins,<br>
then the margin of your life is where He is still moving.</p>
<p>We often think of the margins of life as the leftovers—the spaces between the “real” moments. The waiting rooms. The detours. The delays. The seasons that don’t make it into the highlight reel.</p>
<p>But what if the margin is where the real work happens?</p>
<p>What if the margin is where God speaks most clearly, moves most deeply, and reveals Himself most intimately?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-myth-of-the-main-stage" tabindex="-1">The Myth of the Main Stage</h2>
<p>We live in a culture obsessed with the spotlight. We’re taught to chase the platform, the promotion, the next big thing. But God often does His best work offstage.</p>
<p>Moses met God in the wilderness.<br>
David was anointed in obscurity.<br>
Jesus spent thirty years in silence before three years of ministry.</p>
<p>The margin isn’t the absence of purpose. It’s the preparation for it.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="margin-as-sacred-space" tabindex="-1">Margin as Sacred Space</h2>
<p>When you live with margin-awareness, you begin to see your life differently. You stop rushing through the in-between moments. You stop resenting the waiting. You start looking for God in the quiet corners.</p>
<p>Because He’s there.</p>
<p>He’s in the long commute.<br>
He’s in the sleepless night.<br>
He’s in the seemingly unanswered prayer.<br>
He’s in the ordinary Tuesday.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Surely the Lord is in this place, and I was not aware of it.”<br>
—Genesis 28:16 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jacob said those words after waking from a dream in the middle of nowhere. But God had been there all along. The margin was holy ground.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="living-from-completion" tabindex="-1">Living from Completion</h2>
<p>When you live in the margin, you live from a different posture. You stop striving to become something and start resting in what already is.</p>
<p>God is not figuring you out.<br>
He’s not waiting to see how your story ends.<br>
He’s already there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For we are God’s masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things He planned for us long ago.”<br>
—Ephesians 2:10 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are not becoming His masterpiece.<br>
You are His masterpiece—becoming aware of it.</p>
<p>It is as if God has given us a mirror in which we see what we look like through our own eyes; and a picture of Jesus that allows us to see what we look like to God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.”<br>
—II Corinthians 5:21 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h2 id="margin-as-mission" tabindex="-1">Margin as Mission</h2>
<p>Living in the margin doesn’t mean living passively. It means living purposefully. It means walking through life with the awareness that every moment is sacred, every encounter is divine, and every step is part of the plan.</p>
<p>It means listening more.<br>
Trusting more.<br>
Resting more.<br>
Obeying more.</p>
<p>It means living like you’re already in the presence of the One who wrote your story—because you are!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-5" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>Where are the margins in your life right now?</p>
<p>Are you rushing through them—or resting in them?</p>
<p>What would change if you believed that God was already there?</p>
<p>You don’t have to wait for the next chapter to find Him.<br>
He’s in the margin.<br>
He always has been.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer-7" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Lord, teach me to live in the margin. To stop striving and start trusting. To see You in the quiet places, the in-between spaces, the moments I often overlook. Help me live with the awareness that I am already in Your presence, already in Your plan, already in Your love. Amen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-it-is-finished" tabindex="-1">Interlude: It Is Finished</h2>
<p>The blood of Christ was sufficient to pay the penalty for every lie you ever told or will tell, every sin you ever committed or will commit, every person you ever hurt or will hurt, every lustful thought or action you’ve ever had or will have, every greedy or angry thought you’ve ever had or will have, and every betrayal you ever perpetrated or will perpetrate. It’s not just your past that has been legally covered; it’s your present and future. When Jesus said on the cross, “It is finished,” it was finished… all of it.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-9-the-final-margin" tabindex="-1">Chapter 9: The Final Margin</h2>
<p>If there was a margin before the beginning,<br>
then there is also a margin before the end.</p>
<p>We often think of eternity as something that begins after we die. But eternity doesn’t begin—it simply continues. It has no starting point and no expiration. It is the atmosphere of God Himself.</p>
<p>And just as we were held in the margin before Genesis 1:1, we are being drawn toward the margin before Revelation 22:21—the space before the new beginning.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-end-that-is-really-a-beginning" tabindex="-1">The End That Is Really a Beginning</h2>
<p>The final words of Scripture are not a conclusion. They are a doorway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He who testifies to these things says, ‘Yes, I am coming soon.’ Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.<br>
The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God’s people. Amen.”<br>
—Revelation 22:20–21 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not the end of the story. It’s the doorway to forever.</p>
<p>The same God who stood in the margin before creation now stands in the margin before consummation. And He is calling us forward—not into an ending, but into fullness. When we arrive in heaven, we will realize that we have been there all along.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="already-and-not-yet" tabindex="-1">Already and Not Yet</h2>
<p>We live in the tension of the “already and not yet.”</p>
<p>Christ has already won the victory, but we have not yet seen its full unveiling.<br>
We are already seated with Him in heavenly places, but we are not yet home.<br>
We are already redeemed, but not yet glorified.</p>
<p>This is the final margin—the space between promise and fulfillment.</p>
<p>And just like the margin before Genesis, it is filled with purpose.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-hope-that-anchors" tabindex="-1">The Hope That Anchors</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain…”<br>
—Hebrews 6:19 (NIV)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hope is not wishful thinking. It’s not a vague optimism. It’s an anchor—tethered to the One who already stands at the end of the story.</p>
<p>He is not waiting to see how it all turns out.<br>
He already knows.<br>
He already reigns.<br>
He is already victorious.</p>
<p>And He is drawing us toward that victory, thread by thread, moment by moment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-margin-of-glory" tabindex="-1">The Margin of Glory</h2>
<p>One day, we will step into that final margin.</p>
<p>We will see Him as He is.<br>
We will know as we are fully known.<br>
We will realize that we were never outside of eternity—we were always within it.</p>
<p>And all the margins of our lives—the waiting, the wondering, the wandering—will make sense.</p>
<p>They will be woven into the glory of the One who was, and is, and is to come.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection-6" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What does it mean to live with the end in view?</p>
<p>How would your life change if you believed that eternity is not just ahead of you, but already within you?</p>
<p>You are not waiting for Heaven to begin.<br>
You are walking toward the fullness of what has always been.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer-8" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p>Jesus, You are the Alpha and the Omega—the beginning and the end. Thank You for holding my life between those two points. Help me to live with eternity in my heart, with hope as my anchor, and with trust in the One who already stands at the end of the story. Draw me into the final margin, where all things are made new. Amen.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="interlude-a-prayer" tabindex="-1">Interlude: A Prayer</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.<br>
I’ve seen Your hand.<br>
I’ve experienced a taste of Your love.<br>
I’ve been given a glimpse of Your glory.<br>
But I want to see more of You.</p>
<p>Purify my heart.<br>
Cleanse me.<br>
Reveal my sin.<br>
Burn away my chaff.<br>
I desire a deep cleansing.</p>
<p>Create in me a clean heart – a new heart<br>
So that all that is left standing in me is You.</p>
<p>I don’t want to remember my sin.<br>
I don’t want to long for sinful things.<br>
I seek You.<br>
I seek Your will – Your perfect will.<br>
Fix my mind in innocence,<br>
My imagination in purity.<br>
Lead me in truth.<br>
Steady me with Your hand.</p>
<p>You are all I need.<br>
You are all I want.<br>
O God, purify my heart, for I long to see more of you.</p>
<p>“Jesus said, ‘Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.’”<br>

<h2 id="chapter-10-invitation-to-wonder" tabindex="-1">Chapter 10: Invitation to Wonder</h2>
<p>You’ve walked with me through the margins—<br>
before the beginning,<br>
through the silence,<br>
into the Word,<br>
and across the tapestry of time.</p>
<p>You’ve seen that God is not just the Author of the story—<br>
He is the space in which the story unfolds.</p>
<p>He is before all things,<br>
and in Him, all things hold together.</p>
<p>But this isn’t just a theological truth.<br>
It’s a personal one.</p>
<p>You are not outside of His reach.<br>
You are not outside of His plan.<br>
You are not outside of His love.</p>
<p>You are already in the margin.<br>
Where God lives.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-wonder-of-being-known" tabindex="-1">The Wonder of Being Known</h2>
<p>To live in wonder is to live awake.</p>
<p>Awake to the presence of God in the ordinary.<br>
Awake to the eternal in the everyday.<br>
Awake to the truth that you are fully known, fully loved, and fully held.</p>
<p>Wonder doesn’t require answers.<br>
It requires awareness.</p>
<p>It’s not about figuring everything out.<br>
It’s about standing in awe of the One who already has.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-invitation" tabindex="-1">The Invitation</h2>
<p>So here’s the invitation:</p>
<p>Live like you are already in the presence of God—because you are.<br>
Live like your story is already known—because it is.<br>
Live like the Word is still speaking—because He is.</p>
<p>Return to the margin often.<br>
Pause.<br>
Listen.<br>
Look again.</p>
<p>Because in that sacred space,<br>
you’ll find the One who was there before the beginning<br>
and who will be there beyond the end.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="postlude-if-god-is-everywhere" tabindex="-1">Postlude: If God Is Everywhere…</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then I do not merely walk with Him—<br>
I exist within Him.</p>
<p>I breathe in His presence,<br>
and He breathes through mine.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then “as far as the east is from the west”<br>
is still within His embrace.</p>
<p>There is no exile from His love,<br>
no distance from His gaze.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He sees me as I am,<br>
as I was,<br>
and as I will be—<br>
all at once.</p>
<p>Not in sequence, but in fullness.<br>
Not in progress, but in completion.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He knows everything that can be known about me—<br>
and infinitely more.</p>
<p>The things I hide,<br>
the things I fear,<br>
the things I don’t yet understand about myself—<br>
He holds them all without flinching.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then what I call an obstacle<br>
is both there and not there.</p>
<p>It is real in my time,<br>
but resolved in His.<br>
It is a shadow cast by a light I haven’t yet seen.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then He is not “working on me.”<br>
He has already finished.<br>
I am the one catching up to the masterpiece.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then all of my current and future problems<br>
have already been solved.</p>
<p>All of my questions<br>
already answered.</p>
<p>I am not waiting for clarity—<br>
I am walking toward it.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then maybe when I get to Heaven,<br>
I’ll realize I’ve been there all along.</p>
<p>That eternity was never a destination,<br>
but a dimension I was always tethered to.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then even my sins and weaknesses<br>
will become stained-glass windows—<br>
broken pieces made beautiful<br>
by the light of His grace.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then the power that created galaxies<br>
and raised Jesus from the grave<br>
dwells in me.</p>
<p>Not metaphorically.<br>
Literally.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then I am connected to everything—<br>
because everything exists within Him.</p>
<p>Every atom, every angel,<br>
every moment, every miracle.</p>
<p>If God is everywhere,<br>
then nothing is impossible for me.<br>
Because nothing is impossible for Him.</p>
<p>And He is not just beside me—<br>
He is in me.<br>
And I am in Him.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-author" tabindex="-1">About the Author</h2>
<p>Steve Wilkins is a follower of Jesus, a lifelong student of Scripture, and a storyteller shaped by grace.</p>
<p>After decades of walking with Christ through ministry, failure, restoration, and renewal, Steve entered a profound season of stillness that would forever change how he read the Bible—and how he understood God. During that time, he read Scripture cover to cover fourteen times in twenty-two months, immersing himself in the Word not for answers alone, but for encounter. What emerged was a deep awareness of God’s eternal presence, intentional design, and unwavering faithfulness—a vision that gave birth to <em>Margins: Where God Begins</em>.</p>
<p>Steve writes not as a theologian looking down from the lectern, but as a fellow traveler learning to rest in the spaces between certainty and mystery. His reflections are shaped by years of pastoral ministry, personal loss, unexpected detours, and moments when God revealed Himself most clearly in silence rather than spectacle.</p>
<p>At the heart of Steve’s writing is a simple conviction: God is not reacting to our lives—He is revealing Himself through them. We are not striving toward completion; we are awakening to what has already been finished in Christ.</p>
<p>Steve lives with a deep love for Scripture, a reverence for honest questions, and a passion for helping others recognize God’s presence in the ordinary, the overlooked, and the margins of life. When he’s not reading or writing, he can often be found quietly listening—trusting that God still speaks, and that wonder is still a holy response.</p>

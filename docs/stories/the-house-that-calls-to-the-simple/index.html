  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!<br>
But little do they know that the dead are there, that her guests are deep in the realm of the dead.”</em><br>
<strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+9:17&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proverbs 9:17</a>–18</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Just as Proverbs 5 dissects the anatomy of temptation, Proverbs 9 presents the final, ultimate choice between two competing invitations. The chapter first describes the call of Lady Wisdom, who has built her house, prepared her feast, and sent out her servants to invite the simple to life.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the closing section introduces her counterfeit counterpart: Madam Folly.</p>
<p>Using parallel imagery of a house and a feast, the writer exposes the true nature of folly—its deceptive logic, its hollow promise, and its horrifying destination. What appears to be a feast of pleasure is revealed to be a gathering place of the dead.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-character-of-folly" tabindex="-1">The Character of Folly</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Folly is an unruly woman; she is simple and knows nothing.”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+9:13&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proverbs 9:13</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introduction to Folly is immediate and unflattering. Unlike the order, preparation, and substance of Lady Wisdom, Folly is loud, chaotic, and disruptive. Her appeal is not rooted in truth or confidence, but in noise—demanding attention through sheer volume.</p>
<p>Though she presents herself as authoritative, she is fundamentally ignorant. She lacks understanding, foresight, and the fear of the LORD, which is the beginning of wisdom. Her loud exterior masks a hollow core. Everything she offers is built on emptiness.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-brazen-invitation" tabindex="-1">The Brazen Invitation</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“She sits at the door of her house, on a seat at the highest point of the city…”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+9:14&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proverbs 9:14</a>–16</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folly openly imitates Wisdom. Just as Wisdom sends out her call from the heights of the city, Folly establishes her competing invitation in the same public space. Evil rarely announces itself as evil—it often presents itself as a reasonable alternative.</p>
<p>Her targets are specific: the simple and those who are “going straight on their way.” She preys on the naïve and seeks to divert those who might otherwise continue unhindered. Her invitation echoes Wisdom’s words almost verbatim: <em>“Let all who are simple come to my house.”</em></p>
<p>This reveals one of the great dangers of temptation: it often sounds familiar, reasonable, and inviting. Discernment becomes essential, because folly frequently disguises itself as opportunity.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-secret-allure" tabindex="-1">The Secret Allure</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is delicious!”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+9:17&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proverbs 9:17</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the heart of Folly’s appeal. She does not promise life or virtue; she promises thrill. Her logic rests on the lie that what is forbidden is more satisfying than what is freely given.</p>
<p>“Stolen water” suggests the excitement of transgression. “Food eaten in secret” implies that secrecy enhances pleasure. Folly whispers that God’s boundaries restrict joy, and that true satisfaction lies just beyond obedience.</p>
<p>This is the ancient logic of temptation: appealing to pride, appetite, and the desire to define good on our own terms.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="the-grim-reality" tabindex="-1">The Grim Reality</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“But little do they know that the dead are there…”</em> **—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Proverbs+9:18&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Proverbs 9:18</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The writer pulls back the curtain. The guest who believes they are entering a private feast is actually walking into a tomb. The house is already filled with the dead—former guests whose choices led not to fulfillment, but to ruin.</p>
<p>The destination is not disappointment; it is death. What promised sweetness was poison. What appeared to be freedom was captivity. Folly’s house is not a refuge—it is a grave.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="walking-in-wisdom" tabindex="-1">Walking in Wisdom</h2>
<p>Proverbs 9 offers a stark and final warning. Folly is loud, ignorant, and deceptive. Her invitation mimics wisdom, but her house leads to death. The choice is clear, but it is never neutral.</p>
<p>To walk in wisdom is to practice discernment.</p>
<p>Discern the noise from the voice. Folly shouts. Wisdom invites. One is frantic and demanding; the other is steady and true.</p>
<p>Examine the appeal. Be wary of what draws you primarily because it is hidden or forbidden. Sin thrives in secrecy, but cannot survive in the light.</p>
<p>Consider the guest list. Wisdom’s house is filled with the living. Folly’s house is filled with the dead.</p>
<p>By grace, we are not left to guess. God does not merely warn us—He invites us to life.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>O Lord, our refuge and our wisdom, thank You for setting before us a clear choice between life and death. I confess that my heart is often drawn to the loud voice of Folly and the promise of secret pleasures.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Grant me discernment to see temptation for what it truly is—an empty imitation of Your truth. When Folly calls from the high places, help me hear the deeper voice of Wisdom inviting me to Your life-giving feast.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep my feet on the path of life. Let me find my satisfaction not in secrecy, but in the open, honest abundance You provide.<br>
Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

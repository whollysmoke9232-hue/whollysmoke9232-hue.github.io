<blockquote>
<p><em>And now, Lord, for what do I wait?<br>
My hope is in You.</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+39:7&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Psalm 39:7</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every time I stumble across this verse, it feels like splashing my face with cold water.</p>
<p>I have a tendency to get lost in my fears. What if I never reconcile with my children? What if my ex-wife forgets me? What if I am never able to secure gainful employment? What if I never find a place to live that doesn’t rely on the kindness of friends? What if … What if … It goes on and on.</p>
<p>When I get stuck in this loop, I spend an inordinate amount of time thinking of ways to avoid all my imagined fears. I should write letters to my kids. Send occasional gifts to my ex-wife. Push harder on getting resumes out. Find low-cost housing. I search the internet and query artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I endlessly rework my budget and reexamine what I think I can live without. I look for ways to cut corners on expenses. I imagine conversations with family members. I bury myself in potential scenarios that could guide me in the direction I think I should go.</p>
<p>None of these are wrong; but none bring relief.</p>
<p>Then in the midst of my anxiety, I wander into Psalm 39, and here comes the cold water again to shake me from my funk and remind me of where I actually stand.</p>
<p>I'm reminded ask myself, <em>“For real, Steve! What are you waiting for? What exactly are you thinking you can do to make any real difference in your present or future?”</em> It causes me to refocus on Whose I am.</p>
<p>I rediscover that in order to focus on my fears, I first have to take my eyes off of Jesus.</p>
<p>In my fear, I find that I feel profoundly empty. Nervous. I want to avoid the future. But when my focus turns back to my Saviour, relief comes rushing back in like a flood. Suddenly, my fears lose their grip and I’m once again filled with faith and courage. Eager to embrace my future.</p>
<p>This is a sobering truth; but a welcome one. My hope is in a heavenly Father who has proven that He will never leave or forsake me. Whatever my future may hold, He is in control of it. And if He is in control, I have nothing to fear.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Father,<br>
You see how quickly my mind runs ahead of You.<br>
You see the fears I rehearse and the futures I try to manage.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When my heart asks “What if?”<br>
teach it to answer, “My hope is in You.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Give me courage to do what is mine to do,<br>
and peace to release what is Yours alone.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Help me wait without panic,<br>
trust without pretending,<br>
and rest in the fact that I am Yours.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Amen.</p>
</blockquote>

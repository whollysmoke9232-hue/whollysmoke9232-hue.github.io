  <h1>Never Told Why</h1>

  
    <p><em>Trust is not understanding the script. It is staying in the story with God when you cannot see the reason.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p><em><strong>Reflections on the book of Job</strong></em></p>
<p>Trust is a concept that I thought I understood.</p>
<p>But I didn’t learn about real trust until I believed that I had lost everything, and all I had left was God — if He was still there…</p>
<p>My first few hours in jail were a defining moment for me. It felt like I had nothing. No control. No reputation. No future I could see.</p>
<p>So I reached for the only thing that seemed real.</p>
<p>God.</p>
<p>I held on for dear life.</p>
<p>And ever since then, He has never let go.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is really no way to learn to trust God until you are drowning.</p>
<p>As long as you can still touch the bottom, as long as your feet can still find footing, you are not trusting — you are balancing. You are managing. You are calculating.</p>
<p>Trust begins when control ends.</p>
<p>Job understood this, though he never understood why.</p>
<p>We are given the first two chapters of his story. We are told about the conversation in heaven. We see the challenge, the permission, the boundaries set by God Himself.</p>
<p>Job never hears any of it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He never learns that his suffering was not punishment.<br>
He never learns that heaven was watching.<br>
He never learns that his name had been spoken in the throne room of God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He lives the entire ordeal without the explanation we are given.</p>
<p>And yet he keeps speaking — not perfectly, not politely, not without frustration — but he keeps speaking to God.</p>
<p>That is trust.</p>
<p>We often assume that trust means silence. That faith means calm acceptance. But Job complained. He questioned. He poured out confusion and grief.</p>
<p>He just never walked away.</p>
<p>He complained toward heaven.</p>
<hr>
<p>There is something deeply comforting in knowing that we are never told why either.</p>
<p>We imagine that if we only understood the hidden mechanics — the spiritual battle, the long-term purpose, the future fruit — we could endure more easily.</p>
<p>But God does not grant us a backstage pass.</p>
<p>He asks us to stay in the story without seeing the script.</p>
<p>And somehow, that is enough.</p>
<p>We cannot ruin our lives beyond God’s ability to redeem them.</p>
<p>We can sin. We can wander. We can wreck our own plans. But we cannot outmaneuver His sovereignty. We cannot sabotage His ultimate purpose.</p>
<p>All of the evil inside of me or surrounding me cannot separate me from the love of God.</p>
<p>He is not reacting to my life. He is weaving it.</p>
<p>As Creator and Sustainer, He does not waste material. Even my greatest failures become thread in His hands.</p>
<p>He sends what I need. If He does not send it, I do not need it.</p>
<p>That statement used to offend me. Now it steadies me.</p>
<p>We are like children trying to audit the calculations of a physicist. A seven-year-old does not question advanced mathematics because he lacks the framework to even understand the problem.</p>
<p>Yet we confidently evaluate how God is running the universe.</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Trust does not require understanding. It requires proximity.</p>
<p>Job never stopped praying.</p>
<p>He never received the explanation we received.</p>
<p>But he encountered God.</p>
<p>And in the end, that was more than an answer.</p>
<hr>
<p>God has still never let go.</p>
<p>My life is still a struggle.</p>
<p>I still can’t see the future.</p>
<p>But through it all, I can still have confidence that there is purpose beyond what I can see.</p>
<p>And He is still with me.</p>

  <h1>Seek Him</h1>

  
    <p><em>Prayer does not begin with effort or obligation, but with relationship. We seek God not to earn His favor, but because He has already drawn near to us.</em></p>

  <p>This reflection is meant to be read alongside <a href="/reflections/coming-into-a-place-of-prayer/"><u>Coming Into a Place of Prayer</u></a>.<br>
If that piece asks <em>how</em> we come to God in prayer, this one asks a more foundational question: <em>why</em> we come at all.</p>
<hr>
<p>At the center of the Christian faith is not a method, a discipline, or a checklist—but a Person.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to have a living relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Everything about our faith is centered in Him. Christianity is not <em>Jesus plus something else</em>. It is not Jesus plus prayer, Jesus plus study, Jesus plus service. Jesus <strong>is</strong> God’s plan.</p>
<p>When we ask, <em>“What must I do to become a Christian?”</em> the answer is surprisingly simple:<br>
there is nothing for us to do except believe what has already been done.</p>
<p>He did it all.</p>
<h3 id="paying-attention-so-we-do-not-drift" tabindex="-1">Paying Attention So We Do Not Drift</h3>
<p>The book of Hebrews was written to people who believed—but were slowly drifting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets… but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son…”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1:1&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 1:1</a>–3</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The warning that follows is not about rebellion, but neglect:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We must pay more careful attention… so that we do not drift away.”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+2:1&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hebrews 2:1</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Drift rarely looks dramatic. It looks like busyness. Fatigue. Subtle distance. We still believe the right things—we just stop responding.</p>
<h3 id="the-weight-of-the-oughtas" tabindex="-1">The Weight of the “Oughta’s”</h3>
<p>Many of us live under an unspoken list:</p>
<p>I <em>oughta</em> serve more.<br>
I <em>oughta</em> give more.<br>
I <em>oughta</em> pray more, study more, witness more, do more.</p>
<p>Eventually, the weight of those expectations becomes unbearable.</p>
<p>You might say, <em>“I can’t do all of that.”</em><br>
That’s okay. Because <em>you</em> can't!</p>
<p>You don’t have to do everything. You only have to respond to what <strong>He</strong> is giving you to do.</p>
<p>Jesus said, <em>“My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”</em> If what we are carrying feels crushing, we may be carrying something He never asked us to pick up.</p>
<h3 id="responding-instead-of-performing" tabindex="-1">Responding Instead of Performing</h3>
<p>Our calling is not to work harder—it is to respond.</p>
<p>A simple prayer changes everything:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Lord, I want to respond to You.<br>
I only want to do what You are giving me to do.<br>
What would You have me do today?”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Very often, the answer is not an assignment, but an invitation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Draw near to Me.<br>
Rest in Me.<br>
Seek Me.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We get busy because we worry.<br>
And we worry because we are insecure in our relationship with Him.</p>
<p>Jesus addresses this directly when He tells us not to worry about provision, clothing, or tomorrow. Our Father already knows what we need.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+6:33&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 6:33</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is that naive?<br>
Maybe.<br>
But it is the kind of trust Jesus calls us to.</p>
<h3 id="seeking-is-not-passive" tabindex="-1">Seeking Is Not Passive</h3>
<p>After saying there is nothing to <em>do</em> to earn salvation, Scripture still calls us to action—but a different kind of action.</p>
<p>Seek Him.</p>
<p>Prayer and worship are not religious duties; they are relational responses. We come honestly and simply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Here I am. I need You. I want You. Everything I have, I give to You.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We seek because there is more available than we realize:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<em>No eye has seen, no ear has heard… what God has prepared for those who love Him.”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Corinthians+2:9&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1 Corinthians 2:9</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jesus promises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Ask and keep asking.<br>
Seek and keep seeking.<br>
Knock and keep knocking.”</em> *<strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+7:7&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 7:7</a>–8</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in a beautiful reversal of perspective, we are reminded:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.”</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+19:10&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Luke 19:10</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are not the only ones seeking.</p>
<p>He is seeking us.</p>
<h3 id="a-companion-truth" tabindex="-1">A Companion Truth</h3>
<p>Prayer flows naturally when we understand this:</p>
<p>We do not pray to become God’s children.<br>
We pray <strong>because we already are</strong>.</p>
<p>Seeking is not striving.<br>
It is responding to a God who has already drawn near.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Lord Jesus,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Free me from the weight of the “oughta’s.”<br>
Teach me to rest in what You have already done.<br>
Help me respond—not out of fear or obligation,<br>
but out of love and trust.<br>
Draw me near as I seek You,<br>
and remind me that You have been seeking me all along.<br>
Amen.</p>

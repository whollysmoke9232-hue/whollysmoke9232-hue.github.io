  <h1>Roadblocks</h1>

  
    <p><em>Reflecting on how we can unknowingly step out of alignment with what God is already doing—and what surrender truly looks like.</em></p>

<article class="article-content">
  <p>Why is it so hard to get out of our own way?</p>
<p>If a runaway dump truck were barreling toward us, every fiber of our being would scream, <em>“Get out of the way!”</em> And we would.<br>
If we knew a meteorite was heading for our location, we’d scramble to safety.<br>
If someone intended us harm, we’d instinctively flee.</p>
<p>These are situations where our natural <em>fight or flight</em> response kicks in.</p>
<p>But what about when something <strong>good</strong> is coming our way?</p>
<p>It seems that one of the greatest obstacles to receiving what God desires to do in us is often… <em>us</em>.<br>
Not because God is restrained—but because we are distracted, resistant, or misaligned with His work.</p>
<hr>
<p>I’m reminded of a familiar preacher’s story—not as doctrine, but as illustration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A man died and went to heaven, where Jesus showed him the wonders of eternity—family reunited, the beauty of heaven, and a mansion prepared for him.</p>
<p>Eventually, they came to a street of warehouses. One bore the man’s name. Inside were countless gifts.</p>
<p>“What is all this?” the man asked.</p>
<p>Jesus replied, <em>“These are things I longed to give you—but you were too busy chasing other things.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The point isn’t regret—it’s revelation.</p>
<hr>
<p>Jesus explains this tension in the Parable of the Sower:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“The worries of this life, the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word, making it unfruitful.”</em><br>
—Mark 4:18–19</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice: the problem isn’t evil.<br>
It’s <strong>distraction</strong>.<br>
The “other things” are often good things—just not <strong>Him</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<p>God is not trying to make us better versions of ourselves.<br>
He is making us <strong>new</strong> (Revelation 21:5).</p>
<p>And while God is never limited in power or purpose, <strong>our openness, attention, and surrender determine how much fruit His work produces in us</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the roadblocks aren’t sin—but self-direction.<br>
Even spiritual activity can become an obstacle when it replaces intimacy.<br>
When the focus shifts from the <strong>Giver</strong> to the gifts, from <strong>His presence</strong> to our pursuits, we quietly step out of alignment.</p>
<hr>
<p>So maybe the prayer isn’t,<br>
“God, do something new,”<br>
but rather,<br>
“God, help me stop getting in the way of what You are already doing.”</p>
<p>If you want something you’ve never had,<br>
you may need to release something you’ve been holding too tightly.</p>
<p>Not in defeat—but in trust.</p>
<p><strong>I surrender. I choose Your way. I want Your best—whatever that is.</strong><br>
And sometimes, the holiest thing we can do…<br>
is step aside.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, pull up the thorns.<br>
Expose the subtle distractions.<br>
Align my heart with what You are already doing.<br>
I don’t want more activity—I want <strong>You</strong>.</em><br>
<strong>Amen.</strong></p>

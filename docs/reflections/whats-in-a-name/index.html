    <p><em>Discovering how identity shapes destiny—and how God’s name over us changes everything.</em></p>

  <h3 id="names-then-and-now" tabindex="-1">Names Then and Now</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Now among them from the sons of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah.</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1:6&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel 1:6</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In our modern culture, names often function as little more than labels. They distinguish us on a roster or a form, but they rarely carry deep meaning. I remember a season when it seemed like every other girl was named “Linda”—a popular name, but not one tied to destiny.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, names were different. They were weighty. A name could be a sentence, a prayer, even a prophecy. It declared identity, character, and calling. Children grew up knowing who they were by knowing what their name meant—and who their God was.</p>
<p>What we do often flows from who we believe ourselves to be.</p>
<p>Identity shapes destiny.</p>
<p>Consider the names of Daniel and his friends (<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1:5&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel 1:5</a>–7):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel</strong> — “God is my Judge” (and therefore his Deliverer)</li>
<li><strong>Hananiah</strong> — “The LORD is gracious”</li>
<li><strong>Mishael</strong> — “Who is like God?”</li>
<li><strong>Azariah</strong> — “The LORD is my helper”</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice this: their names say more about <strong>God</strong> than about them.<br>
Their worth and identity were rooted not in performance, but in who God is.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="babylons-renaming-strategy" tabindex="-1">Babylon’s Renaming Strategy</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Then the commander of the officials assigned new names to them; and to Daniel he assigned the name Belteshazzar, to Hananiah Shadrach, to Mishael Meshach and to Azariah Abed-nego.</em> <strong>—<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+1:7&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daniel 1:7</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These four young men—likely no older than fifteen—were taken into Babylon, the cultural and spiritual center of a pagan empire. God placed them there as witnesses, not by force or rebellion, but by faithfulness.</p>
<p>The first thing Nebuchadnezzar did was rename them.</p>
<p>Satan understands identity. He knows that if he can redefine who we are, behavior will follow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belteshazzar</strong> — “Under the authority of Bel”</li>
<li><strong>Shadrach</strong> — “Under the command of Aku”</li>
<li><strong>Meshach</strong> — “Who is like Sheshach”</li>
<li><strong>Abednego</strong> — “Servant of Nego”</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t it striking that we often remember their Babylonian names instead of their God-given ones?</p>
<p>Yet despite what they were called, these men lived according to the names they had grown up with. They knew who they <em>were</em>. They refused to internalize the lie.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-names-we-accept" tabindex="-1">The Names We Accept</h3>
<p>The same strategy is still at work. We are all given names throughout our lives.</p>
<p>“You’re worthless.”<br>
“You’ll never change.”<br>
“You’re a failure.”<br>
“You’re unlovable.”</p>
<p>Sometimes the names sound flattering—status, success, comparison—but they still define us apart from God.</p>
<p>If we don’t know who we are in Him, we will accept almost any name offered. And once we accept a name, we tend to live consistently with it—even when it destroys us.</p>
<p>Behavior modification alone never lasts.</p>
<p>Identity transformation does.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="your-new-name-in-christ" tabindex="-1">Your New Name in Christ</h3>
<p>The Gospel announces something radical:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The names given to you by the world are dead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Christ, you are no longer defined by your past, your failures, or the labels others gave you. You now bear <strong>His Name</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ lives in me <strong>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galations+2:20&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Galations 2:20</a>)</strong></li>
<li>Loved by God <strong>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+3:16&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John 3:16</a>)</strong></li>
<li>The righteousness of God <strong>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Corinthians+5:21&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>)</strong></li>
<li>Washed and redeemed <strong>(I<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=+Corinthians+6:11&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Corinthians 6:11</a>)</strong></li>
<li>Light of the world <strong>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+5:14-16&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Matthew 5:14-16</a>)</strong></li>
<li>More than a conqueror  <strong>(<a class="scripture-inline" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+8:37&version=NASB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Romans 8:37</a>)</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When we act out of step with this new identity, conviction rises—not as condemnation, but as confirmation. The discomfort proves something new has taken root.</p>
<p>They may call you many things.</p>
<p>But if they don’t use your true name, you don’t have to answer.</p>

  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Scripture Focus: Daniel 1; 3; 6:1–24</em></p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<h3 id="names-then-and-now" tabindex="-1">Names Then and Now</h3>
<p>In our modern culture, names often function as little more than labels. They distinguish us on a roster or a form, but they rarely carry deep meaning. I remember a season when it seemed like every other girl was named “Linda”—a popular name, but not one tied to destiny.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, names were different. They were weighty.<br>
A name could be a sentence, a prayer, even a prophecy. It declared identity, character, and calling. Children grew up knowing who they were by knowing what their name meant—and who their God was.</p>
<p>What we do often flows from who we believe ourselves to be.<br>
Identity shapes destiny.</p>
<p>Consider the names of Daniel and his friends (Daniel 1:5–7):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daniel</strong> — “God is my Judge” (and therefore his Deliverer)</li>
<li><strong>Hananiah</strong> — “The LORD is gracious”</li>
<li><strong>Mishael</strong> — “Who is like God?”</li>
<li><strong>Azariah</strong> — “The LORD is my helper”</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice this: their names say more about <strong>God</strong> than about them.<br>
Their worth and identity were rooted not in performance, but in who God is.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="babylons-renaming-strategy" tabindex="-1">Babylon’s Renaming Strategy</h3>
<p>These four young men—likely no older than fifteen—were taken into Babylon, the cultural and spiritual center of a pagan empire. God placed them there as witnesses, not by force or rebellion, but by faithfulness.</p>
<p>The first thing Nebuchadnezzar did was rename them.</p>
<p>Satan understands identity. He knows that if he can redefine who we are, behavior will follow.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Belteshazzar</strong> — “Under the authority of Bel”</li>
<li><strong>Shadrach</strong> — “Under the command of Aku”</li>
<li><strong>Meshach</strong> — “Who is like Sheshach”</li>
<li><strong>Abednego</strong> — “Servant of Nego”</li>
</ul>
<p>Isn’t it striking that we often remember their Babylonian names instead of their God-given ones?</p>
<p>Yet despite what they were called, these men lived according to who they <em>were</em>. They refused to internalize the lie.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-names-we-accept" tabindex="-1">The Names We Accept</h3>
<p>The same strategy is still at work.</p>
<p>“You’re worthless.”<br>
“You’ll never change.”<br>
“You’re a failure.”<br>
“You’re unlovable.”</p>
<p>Sometimes the names sound flattering—status, success, comparison—but they still define us apart from God.</p>
<p>If we don’t know who we are in Him, we will accept almost any name offered.<br>
And once we accept a name, we tend to live consistently with it—even when it destroys us.</p>
<p>Behavior modification alone never lasts.<br>
Identity transformation does.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="your-new-name-in-christ" tabindex="-1">Your New Name in Christ</h3>
<p>The Gospel announces something radical:<br>
your old name has died.</p>
<p>In Christ, you are no longer defined by your past, your failures, or the labels others gave you. You now bear <strong>His Name</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ lives in me</li>
<li>Loved by God</li>
<li>The righteousness of God</li>
<li>Washed and redeemed</li>
<li>Light of the world</li>
<li>More than a conqueror</li>
</ul>
<p>When we act out of step with this new identity, conviction rises—not as condemnation, but as confirmation. The discomfort proves something new has taken root.</p>
<p>They may call you many things.<br>
But if they don’t use your true name, you don’t have to answer.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reflection" tabindex="-1">Reflection</h2>
<p>What names has your past—or the world—tried to place on you?<br>
Which ones have you quietly accepted?</p>
<p>What name does God speak over you in Christ—and how might living from that identity change the way you respond this week?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="takeaway-thought" tabindex="-1">Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>You don’t live differently by trying harder—you live differently by remembering who you are.</p>

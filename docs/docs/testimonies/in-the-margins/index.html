  <h1>In the Margins</h1>

  
    <p><em>A reflection on Scripture, time, and the holy space before the beginning—where God already knew every moment of our lives.</em></p>

<main class="main-page">
  <p>What is your favorite place in the Bible?</p>
<p>Is it a verse? A passage? A chapter? A book? Or maybe an entire section of Scripture?</p>
<p>Some are naturally drawn to <strong>John 3:16</strong>. I love that verse.<br>
Others are drawn to the nativity, or the resurrection of Christ.<br>
For some, it’s the letters; for others, the Gospels.<br>
Maybe it’s the creation account—or the consummation in Revelation.<br>
Then there’s the history, the law, the poetry, and the prophets.</p>
<p>I’ve grown to love all of these. I could make an argument for why each might be my favorite.</p>
<p>Yet none of them are.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="a-season-saturated-in-scripture" tabindex="-1">A Season Saturated in Scripture</h2>
<p>For most of 2023 and 2024, God placed me in a season with an abundance of time. Out of boredom at first, I began reading—<strong>10 to 14 hours a day</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve always loved reading, but never like this. I assembled a sizable collection of Christian books and read dozens—many of them multiple times. Yet none of them held me the way Scripture did.</p>
<p>My absolute go-to book was the Bible.</p>
<p>From early morning until bedtime, I was drawn to God’s Word. I spent the vast majority of my days there.</p>
<p>I’ve been a student of Scripture for <strong>45 years</strong>. This wasn’t new territory. But during this season, I read the Bible straight through—<strong>Genesis to Revelation</strong>.</p>
<p>It began innocently enough. My first Bible arrived—a Gideons Bible. Naturally, I went to Genesis. I’ve spent more time there over the last 30 years than anywhere else. But this time, when I reached the end of Genesis, I just kept going.</p>
<p>Exodus.<br>
Leviticus.<br>
Numbers.<br>
Deuteronomy.<br>
The histories.<br>
The prophets.<br>
The letters.</p>
<p>Until I finished Revelation.</p>
<p>I was pleased with myself. I’d read the Bible cover to cover in less than a month.</p>
<p>Then a problem emerged.</p>
<p>I still had time.</p>
<p>So I went back to Genesis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="reading-the-word-aloud" tabindex="-1">Reading the Word Aloud</h2>
<p>Before I reached Exodus, I made a new friend—legally blind, hungry for God, and unfamiliar with Scripture. He had attended church a few times, but had never read the Bible.</p>
<p>So I started again at the beginning—this time <strong>reading out loud</strong>.</p>
<p>For nearly <strong>14 hours a day</strong>, I read Genesis, then Exodus, then on. I paused to answer questions. To explain. To marvel together.</p>
<p>We made it to <strong>Ruth</strong> before it was time for him to move on.</p>
<p>I was heartbroken to see him leave.</p>
<p>During that time, he came to faith in Christ. We prayed together every night. We talked endlessly about God, Scripture, and life.</p>
<p>I learned firsthand the power of <strong>hearing</strong> God’s Word spoken.</p>
<p>What a gift those days were.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="fourteen-times-through-the-bible" tabindex="-1">Fourteen Times Through the Bible</h2>
<p>After he left, I kept going.</p>
<p>Ruth to Revelation.<br>
Then back to Genesis again.</p>
<p>By the end of <strong>22 months</strong>, I had read the Bible cover to cover <strong>14 times</strong>.</p>
<p>I now own multiple Bibles I’ve read all the way through:</p>
<ul>
<li>NIV</li>
<li>NASB</li>
<li>NLT</li>
<li>RSV</li>
<li>NKJV</li>
</ul>
<p>Several are study Bibles. I loved the notes, charts, maps, and articles. But more than anything, I loved <strong>how it all fits together</strong>.</p>
<p>God taught me.<br>
Corrected me.<br>
Stretched me.<br>
Changed me.</p>
<p>And with every reading, <strong>He got bigger</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="seeing-the-story-as-one" tabindex="-1">Seeing the Story as One</h2>
<p>One of the greatest gifts of staying saturated in Scripture was seeing how the whole story unfolds.</p>
<p>How Genesis illuminates Paul’s letters.<br>
How the prophets only make sense in light of Israel’s history.<br>
How nothing stands alone.</p>
<p>No moment—and no person—appears by accident.</p>
<p>Take <strong>Levi</strong>, the tax collector.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“After these things, He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting in the tax office. And He said to him, ‘Follow Me.’ So he left all, rose up, and followed Him.”<br>
—Luke 5:27–28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Levi wasn’t scenery.</p>
<p>He had parents.<br>
A past.<br>
Friends.<br>
Enemies.<br>
Experiences—some beautiful, some painful.</p>
<p>Every one of those moments conspired to place him <strong>at that desk, on that day</strong>, when Jesus walked by.</p>
<p>God orchestrated it all.</p>
<p>The same is true of Abraham. Moses. David. Isaiah. John. Zacchaeus.<br>
(Just imagine the lengths God went to protect that sycamore tree.)</p>
<p>God knows.<br>
God plans.<br>
And His plan was complete <strong>before anything began</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="my-favorite-place-in-the-bible" tabindex="-1">My Favorite Place in the Bible</h2>
<p>Now, take your Bible.</p>
<p>Open it to <strong>Genesis 1:1</strong>.</p>
<p>Look just to the left of that first word.</p>
<p>That margin.</p>
<p>That is my favorite place in the Bible.</p>
<p>Before creation.<br>
Before light.<br>
Before words.</p>
<p><strong>God knew.</strong></p>
<p>Everything from <em>Genesis 1:1</em> to <em>Revelation 22:21</em>—and beyond—was already fully known.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your eyes saw my unformed body.<br>
All the days ordained for me were written in Your book<br>
before one of them came to be.”<br>
—Psalm 139:16</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Lamb who was slain from the creation of the world.”<br>
—Revelation 13:8</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For He chose us in Him before the creation of the world.”<br>
—Ephesians 1:4</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“He was chosen before the creation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for your sake.”<br>
—1 Peter 1:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that tiny margin before Genesis 1:1, all of history—past, present, and future—already existed in the mind of God.</p>
<p>And then He began to paint.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="living-in-the-knowing-of-god" tabindex="-1">Living in the Knowing of God</h2>
<p>I often return to that margin.</p>
<p>I lie in bed at night and meditate on that instant before the beginning. And in that instant—He was already here. With me. With you. With this very moment.</p>
<p>This moment has never been outside His knowing or His care.</p>
<p>We are not puppets. We make real choices.<br>
But every moment of our lives has always been <strong>known</strong> by Him—and now belongs <strong>to</strong> Him.</p>
<p>The God who stands before the beginning also stands with us here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“I AM Who I AM.”</strong><br>
—Exodus 3:14</p>

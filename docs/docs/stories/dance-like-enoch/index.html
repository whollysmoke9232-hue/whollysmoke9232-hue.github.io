  <h1>I Wanna Dance Like Enoch Danced</h1>

  
    <p><em>A longing to walk so closely with God that worship becomes intimacy—and intimacy becomes eternity.</em></p>

<main class="main-page">
  <h2 id="key-scripture" tabindex="-1">Key Scripture</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.”</em><br>
—Genesis 5:24</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Enoch didn’t perform for God.<br>
He didn’t impress God.<br>
He <strong>walked</strong> with God.</p>
<p>So closely, so consistently, so intimately that one day heaven simply folded him in.</p>
<p>That kind of walk has always stirred something deep in my soul.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-broken-beginning" tabindex="-1">The Broken Beginning</h3>
<p>In 1999, we didn’t plan revival.<br>
We didn’t schedule an awakening.<br>
We simply reached the end of ourselves—and God met us there.</p>
<p>Our church had lost leadership and direction, but in that vacuum, the Spirit stirred hunger. Prayer became our oxygen. Worship became our warfare.</p>
<p>And one Sunday, heaven interrupted the ordinary.</p>
<p>People rushed the altar. They wept, collapsed, cried out. Salvation came—not only in the sanctuary, but in hallways, parking lots, and whispered conversations. Marriages were restored. Callings ignited. Lives changed.</p>
<p>As the worship leader, I witnessed it firsthand.</p>
<p>I saw the Spirit sweep across the room.<br>
I saw people fall under a weight they could not explain.<br>
And in moments I can only describe as holy and humbling, I became deeply aware that worship was participating in something far bigger than sound or song.</p>
<p>This is not a formula.<br>
It is not something to reproduce or manufacture.<br>
It was simply God’s presence responding to surrendered hearts.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-praise" tabindex="-1">The Cost of Praise</h3>
<p>Isaiah cried, <em>“Woe is me… I am undone.”</em><br>
And that’s how I felt.</p>
<p>Undone by holiness.<br>
Exposed by pride.</p>
<p>True worship costs something. Not money. Not talent.<br>
<strong>Pride.</strong></p>
<p>David understood it when he said,<br>
<em>I will not offer to the Lord that which costs me nothing.</em></p>
<p>To worship freely, I must release my need to appear composed.<br>
To walk closely, I must die to self-awareness and awaken to intimacy.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="walking-not-performing" tabindex="-1">Walking, Not Performing</h3>
<p>Enoch’s legacy wasn’t built on moments—it was built on movement.<br>
Step after step. Day after day.<br>
A life oriented toward God.</p>
<p>Worship, at its truest, is not spectacle.<br>
It is alignment.</p>
<p>And when alignment happens, heaven and earth respond.</p>
<p>What I once described as “feeding angels” was my limited language for a deeper truth: when God’s people surrender in worship, the spiritual atmosphere shifts. Praise does not empower God—but it <strong>positions us</strong> within what He is already doing.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="legacy-through-intimacy" tabindex="-1">Legacy Through Intimacy</h3>
<p>Wayne Watson once sang,<br>
<em>“I want to get so close to Him that it’s no big change on that day when Jesus calls my name.”</em></p>
<p>That was Enoch’s life.</p>
<p>And his walk didn’t end with him. It echoed forward—through Noah, through generations, through history.</p>
<p>What if our worship today is shaping tomorrow’s faith?<br>
What if our intimacy becomes someone else’s inheritance?</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="prayer" tabindex="-1">Prayer</h2>
<p><em>Lord, teach me to walk with You—not perform for You.<br>
Kill my pride.<br>
Strip away my self-consciousness.<br>
Make me childlike again.<br>
Let my worship be obedience, and my obedience intimacy.<br>
Draw me so close that heaven never feels foreign.</em></p>
<p><strong>Amen.</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="takeaway-thought" tabindex="-1">Takeaway Thought</h2>
<p>True worship isn’t about how it looks—it’s about how closely we walk.<br>
And when we walk with God long enough, eternity feels like a natural next step.</p>
